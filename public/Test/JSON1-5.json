He must conduct a running examination and periodic reexaminations of the self in language, the medium of farthest reaches, deepest driving, most complicated windings. The sorting through might well begin with the ordinary, everyday experience of life. A diary of journal enables one to examine and evaluate experiences, as well as to come to understand them and their significance or insignificance. Most of us do this examination and evaluation in moments of dreaming or in that state of mental wandering just before sleep. There is some (even great) advantage, however, in subjecting ourselves to the discipline of written language, in which the vague and the confusing and the poorly defined give way to the specific, the firm, and the clearly formulated.\n\nFor writing is discovery. The language that never leaves our head is like colorful yarn, which endlessly spins out multicolored threads dropping into an emptiness, momentarily compacted, entangled, fascinating, and elusive. We have glimpses that seem brilliant but quickly fade; we catch sight of images that tease us with connections and patterns that too-soon flow on; we hold in momentary view a comprehensive arrangement (insight) that dissolves rapidly and disappears.\n\nWriting that is discovery forces the capturing, the retrieving, the bringing into focus these stray and random thoughts. Examining them, we form ideas that are as much about the self as about language. Indeed, writing is largely a process of choosing, among alternatives from the images and thoughts of the endless flow, and this choosing is the matter of making up one's mind, and this making up one's mind becomes in effect the making up of one's self. In this way writing that is honest and genuine and serious constitutes the discovery of the self."

          "content": "What should we think of the global euphoria over \"dotcom\" companies? Undoubtedly, Internet technology' will change the way we live, work, communicate and do business. But beware of those who proclaim this to be a New Era of profitability. As in the so-called New Eras of the past brought on by earlier technological breakthroughs this one carries the seeds of its own destruction. The phenomenal growth of Internet businesses is already fueling a Klondike-style.gold rush, with far too many diggers looking for far too little gold. Economics teaches us that it is hard to make money with a basically free commodity. Think of ice in the Arctic, sand in the desert, seawater in the ocean or, for that matter, the seemingly unlimited “hot air” on the Net.\n\nIn the 20th century, the proliferation of cars, radios, movies, televisions, mass retailers and computers all inspired a sense that we had begun a New Era. Each breakthrough promised new riches and unprecedented prosperity for the innovators. But in the long run, they always failed to deliver to investors the expected rewards.\n\nWhy the letdowns? In part because every great innovator invariably attracted great imitators, who competed with the original and eventually depressed his \"excessive\" profit margin by commoditizing the invention. Furthermore, great inventions have always been followed by greater innovations, which, through the process known as creative destruction, render the previous new technology obsolete. And when inventions become vital to the economy, they are frequently brought under the control of governments via regulation, nationalization and, in extreme cases, expropriation.\n\nTake the Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825. Its success led to the great American canal boom of the 1830s. It ended just a few years later in a tremendous bust, as most of the other canals failed to make money. The Erie. too, began to suffer from competition, first from railroads and, eventually, from trucks. In the end, the railroad industry which helped create an unprecedented industrial boom proved to be disastrous for most investors. By 1895, most U.S. railroads had to be restructured\n\nNow-familiar technologies like cars, radios, cash registers and mainframe computers were all at some point new and revolutionary. But the spread of the technologies led inevitably to the demise of their creators' \"excessive\" profits, as each became just another commodity. Don't think for a minute that the Internet will be any different."

          "content": "We used to have simple, unsophisticated tastes and looked with suspicion at anything more exotic than hamburgers. Admittedly, we did adopt some foods from the various immigrant groups who flicked to ours shores. We learned to eat Chinese food, pizza, and bagels. But in the last few years, the international character of our diet has grown tremendously. We can walk into any mall in Middle America and buy pita bread, quiches, and tacos. Such foods are often changed on their journey from exotic imports to ordinary \"American\" meals. (no Pakistani, for example, eats frozen-on-a-stick boysenberry-flavored yogurt), but the imports are still a long way from hamburger on a bun.\n\nWhy have we become more worldly in our tastes? For one thing; the television blankets the country with information about new food products and trends. Viewers in rural Montana know that the latest craving in Washington, D. C. is Cajun cookings or that something called tofu is now available in the local supermarket. Another reason for the growing international flavor of our food is that many young Americans have traveled abroad and gotten hooked on new tastes and flavors. Backpacking students and young professional vacationing in Europe come home with craving for authentic French bread or German beer. Finally, continuing waves of immigrants settle in the cities where many of us live, causing significant changes in what we eat. In time, the new food will become Americanized enough to take its place in our national dieta\n\nOur growing concern with health has also affected the way we eat. For the last few years, the media has warned us about the dangers of our traditional diet, high in salt and fat, low in fiber. The media also began to educate us about the dangers of processed foods and manufacturers started to change some of their products. Many foods, such as lunch meat, canned vegetables, and soups were made available in low-fat, low-sodium versions. Whole grain cereals and high fiber breads also began to appear on the grocery shelves. Moreover, the food industry started to produce all. natural products everything from potato chips to ice cream without additives and preservatives. Not surprisingly, the restaurant industry responded to this switch to healthier foods, luring customers with salad bars, broiled fish, and steamed vegetables.."

          "content": "Freud was born on May 6, 1856, in the Moravian town of Freiberg, then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today a part of Czechoslovakia. The family settled in Vienna in 1860, where as a Jew he enjoyed potential and respect only recently gained with the opening of the Hapsburg Empire's liberal era. Encouraged to think grandly, he poured his energy and gifts into school. At age seventeen, he entered the University of Vienna, where he studied in the faculty of medicine. Engrossed in his studies, he did not graduate until 1881. {{61}}\n\nOver the winter of 1885-1886, Freud studied in Paris with a French: professor of neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot. {{62}} Freud went on to make nervous ailments his specialty, concentrating on hysteria. Freud's years of work put a new way of thinking into the head of society, and challenged the assumptions and suppositions of a changing world.\n\nA period of intense work and self-analysis, further inspired by the death of his father, led Freud to his publication of The Interpretation of Dreams in 1900, and of Psychopathology of Everyday Life in 1901. {{63}} By 1902 he finally gained the position of associate professor at the University of Vienna.\n\nIn 1908, he transformed a Wednesday-night club of Viennese physicians into the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, and his new field began to gain wider acceptance. This period was marked by extensive case studies and theoretical work; as well, he published papers on religion, literature, sculpture, and other non-scientific fields.\n\nDespite some contentious internal politics, psychoanalysis continued to flourish, until World War I took the subjects to the front lines and the analysts to the medical corps. But Freud was not idle: in 1915, he delivered a series of introductory lectures at the University of Vienna, lectures which, when published in 1917, secured him a wide popular audience. A flurry of work, inspired by the death of his daughter Sophie, resulted in the 1920 Beyond the Pleasure Principle and the 1923 The Ego and the Id. The latter work contained a final formulation of his structural theory of the mind.\n\nEven while he became a household word, while his ideas were absorbed by an eager populace, Freud was undergoing painful surgery for cancer in late 1923. {{64}}\n\nHe remained in Vienna despite the rumblings of this catastrophe, as Hitler rose to power and Anti-Semitism swept Europe. {{65}} There, he continued to write, until on September 23, 1939, he finally demanded of his physician a lethal dose of morphine.",

          "content": "There are not many exceptions to the marketing rule, that ideas that are good are not new, and those that new are not good. But last week I discovered one in a Seattle company called Amazon.com, which sells books over the Internet. Before revealing this good new marketing idea, it might be worth explaining something about its inventor, since Amazon.com is one of the few genuinely useful shopping services on the World Wide Web.\n\nThe company runs a Web site, accessible from any PC with a browser, that contains a catalogue of two thirds of the 1.5m English books in print. Finding a title using a search engine, customers can check its availability online, and then order it immediately with a credit card.\n\nShipping prices start at 43 plus 95 cents per book, with higher charges for international and overnight services. But the company discounts 300,000 titles, so most US customers will find that delivery is effectively free. These elements, together with a stock list six times larger than any physical bookseller in the world, make Amazon.com the quickest and most convenient way to buy books I have encountered.\n\nIt is also good for presents: sending a book to someone, buyers can choose from three different wrapping papers and type a message. Such a service is not easy to deliver. The key is that Amazon.com has live electronic links to a dozen wholesalers. Apart from 500 bestsellers, the company keeps zero inventories.\n\nWhen a customer orders a book, Amazon.com orders it from the wholesaler, and when the book arrives in its Seattle warehouse it is barcoded and sent by the company's computer to a bin where the customer's order is being assembled. When all the books in an order have arrived, usually the same day, a manifest is printed and the books are packed for shipping.\n\nThe company's founder Jeff Bezos, 31, is a former investment banker. He says his company is now in an explosive growth stage, doubling in size every 2.4 months. But it cannot continue like this for long. If it did, Amazon.com's sales would exceed US GDP in two years.\n\nUntil recently, its site was as alluring as a copy of \"books in print.\" \"It astounds me how many books we sell,\" says Bezos, “given that we didn't offer people enough information to make decisions.\" The first step to remedying this has been to add blurbs, delivered electronically by publishers, to 170,000 of the listings. The company also invites customers to write reviews, which are then linked by hypertext to the books. And it links book listings to \"interviews” with authors themselves written by filling out a form on a Web page. In future Amazon. com will make these truly interactive, so that readers can ask their favorite authors questions over the Web without having to attend a signing.\n\nAnother service is that the company is planning to put customers in touch with each other. Bezos admits that in a physical bookstore, he rarely has the nerve to look over a fellow's shoulder and recommend a book. “Online, I'd do it in a heartbeat.\" So the company will allow buyers to become \"visible\" if they choose, and to chat online with others browsing electronically in the same subject areas.\n\nAnd the new marketing idea is called associates. By filling in a form on the Amazon Web site, owners of other sites can sign up for a scheme that pays them commissions for referring their own users to the online bookstore. Users will see a page of recommended books on their favorite Web site. Clicking on a title will jump them straight to Amazon.com's order form for that book. If they buy it, the referring Web site gets 8% of the gross. I see it more as a new kind of network marketing, in which Amazon.com has the potential to sign up millions of owners of special-interest Web sites in a vast electronic sales force."

One hafiz of Koran who had obtained top position said that in Israel children were only taught religion in the first 15 years, but in Pakistan the syllabi were being purged of Islam and Islamic seminaries were being closed down. A boy from Isakhel said that his area needed more colleges especially women's colleges. In the girls college in Isakhel there was only one teacher and the girls had to sit on the floor.\n\nThe information given by the hafiz boy on Israel is not correct. Israel is 97 per cent literate and girls' literacy is 93 per cent. The state-run institutions are not religious. There is a parallel system of religious schools run by the orthodox Jews but that is a minority. In state-run schools, there is no system of 15 years of purely religious education. The state of Israel has not yet been declared a religious state. It doesn't yet have a constitution. For all practical purposes it is a secular state with a strong presence of the religious parties in the Knesset because of Israel's proportional representation system.\n\nOne girl from Peshawar said that private schools had better quality because they taught from imported books. All the students agreed that in English medium schools science education was of better quality because science could not be translated into Urdu. In any case after matriculation students had to convert to English and thus English medium schools were essential. The boy from Isakhel confessed that Urdu did not help in science and that English is essential for which better teachers should be provided. The top students were more interested in saving the Islamic values.\n\nThe girl from Peshawar put her finger on a very important issue. What should we do about the English medium schools? Most politicians who want to change Pakistan and make it better want the English medium schools abolished in favor of equality. There is confusion here on two points. Do we want equality or uniformity? The ideologue wants uniformity of thought and most of us are for ideology as that would enable us better to combat the world. Do we want economic advancement from education or formation of personality? If both, then how do we maintain the balance? Urdu medium schools are at a disadvantage not only because they are less well resourced but also because their science students have to convert to English after matriculation. Across the border, India is less tortured over this issue."

Giordano is good news for all those who wish to keep themselves updated with the latest trends. The brand is doing well in the cosmopolitan city. But then, what doesn't do well there? A famous name, a bit of style...that is all you need to make a place run successfully. Lahore is a different kind of market. Brands here need to offer something more than just their names. Established in 1981, Giordano places emphasis on good fabric and clean cuts, and thus has a relatively good chance of capturing the Lahori market.\n\nThe quiet opening ceremony was held on July 30th and that is probably the reason why most people don't even know Giordano has opened. Is that a marketing gimmick or just a blunder on their behalf? The outlet, located in a basement, is usually hard to find. It literally took me four rounds of the market before I could spot that GIORDANO board. When you think of a basement, you think of a dark gloomy place with spider webs all over. But walking down the stairs to this outlet makes you feel fresh and bright. The shop's interior is done in white, with big posters all over.\n\nThe idea is the outcome of a partnership between Mr. Janjua and Mr. Majid who own the sole distribution of Giordano in Lahore. According to them, the shop has been very successful so far, with the male customers proving to be much more responsive than the female ones. Could this be because our men have all the time in the world and are forever \"on the round\"?\n\nWhen asked about Giordano's competitors in the market, Janjua said that the brand did not have any as such. He feels that Levis and Nike cater to a completely different segment and unless brands like GAP come into the market, Giordano faces no threat. Now that might be called living in a fools' paradise. People here normally have a perception that all international brands are good and alike. Giordano will have to offer something more than just the name and that might take time and effort.\n\nThe start could have been more exciting. People hardly know about the outlet, where it is, what they offer, etc. One billboard is not enough for a market that is surrounded by advertisements. We hope Giordano understands the Lahori psyche, which feels big is better!"

Readers perceive an end-product, a result of a decision making process; they do not have access to pathways leading to decisions, to the dilemmas to be resolved by the translator. What is available for scrutiny is the end-product, the result of translation practice rather than the practice itself. In other words, we are looking at translation as product instead of translating as process. Bell suggests that the tendency to ignore the process involved in the act of translating lies behind the relative stagnation of translation studies in recent years. If we treat text merely as a self-contained and self-generating entity, instead of as a decision-making procedure and an instance of communication between language users, our understanding of the nature of translating will be impaired.\n\nThe view that underlies this book, then, is of translation as a process, involving the negotiation of meaning between producers and receivers of texts. In other words, the resulting translated texts are to be seen as evidence of a transaction, a means of retracing the pathways of the translators, decision-making procedures. In the same way, the source text is an end product and again should be treated as evidence of a writer's intended meaning rather than as the embodiment of the meaning itself. In translating metaphor, for example, there is little point in seeking to match target-language words with those in the source-language in isolation from a consideration of the writer's whole worldview. Occurrence of metaphor has a cumulative effect which suggests a particular perception of reality and it is this which the translator seeks to capture.\n\nIn this sense, texts can be seen as the result of motivated choice: producers of texts have their own communicative aims and select lexical items and grammatical arrangement to serve those aims. Naturally, in translating, there are potentially two sets of motivations: those of the producer of the source text and those of the translator."

          "content": "Carnivorous animals have many unique characteristics which set them apart from all other members of the animal kingdom. They all possess a very simple and short digestive system — only three times the length of their bodies. {{61}} Meat-eating animals that hunt in the cool of the night and sleep during the day when it is hot do not need sweat glands to cool their bodies; they therefore do not perspire through their skin, but rather they sweat through their tongues. On the other hand, vegetarian animals spend much of their time in the sun gathering their food, and they freely perspire through their skin to cool their bodies. {{62}} Along with sharp claws, all meat-eaters, since they have to kill mainly with their teeth, possess powerful jaws and pointed, elongated, \"canine\" teeth to pierce tough hide and to spear and tear flesh. They do NOT have molars (flat, back teeth) which vegetarian animals need for grinding their food. Unlike grains, flesh does not need to be chewed in the mouth to predigest it; it is digested mostly in the stomach and the intestines. {{63}} Grass-and-leaf-eating animals live on grass, herbs, and other plants, much of which is coarse and bulky. {{64}} For this reason, grass-and-leaf eaters have 24 special \"molar\" teeth and a slight side-to-side motion to grind their food, as opposed to the exclusively up-and-down motion of carnivores. They have no claws or sharp teeth; they drink by sucking water up into their mouths. Since they do not eat rapidly decaying foods like the meat eaters, and since their food can take a longer time to pass through, they have much longer digestive systems — intestines which are ten times the length of the body. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that a meat diet has an extremely harmful effect on these grass-and-leaf eaters. If a half pound of animal fat is added daily over a long period of time to a rabbit's diet, after two months his blood vessels become caked with fat and the serious disease called atherosclerosis (动脉粥样硬化) develops. {{65}}",

              "correctAnswer": "A doctor's function has changed over time. In the past, the doctor was a person who treated the diseases. Now a doctor is a stranger who combats diseases. They are expected not only to prevent death but also to improve their patient's quality of life. Many times there is nothing a doctor can do to prevent a patient from dying if the patient has a terminal disease; all he/she can do is waiting for death to arrive. This waiting time can be very painful for both the patients and the people who surround them. Not practicing euthanasia at the request of the dying person is violating a person's rights, creating an economic burden and increasing suffering. First of all, deciding to be alive or not is a personal decision. Neither the doctors nor the government has the power to decide if you should live or not. Since it is not their life and you are not in your situation, they cannot make that kind of decision for you. They give us the liberty to decide our job, our family, our religion, and even our sex preference. Why should they not give us the right to decide if we want to live or not? Next, the economic factor should be considered. Many times we are just wasting time and money on a situation that won't get better. If the patient wants euthanasia, why not do it and end the huge amount of money wasted on a treatment that won't help.. Finally, the basic reason why euthanasia should be practiced is because it stops the person from suffering. Having a patient suffering is not giving him a better quality of life. When the patient feels he is not getting the quality of life he wants, the least a doctor can do is grant him what he wants. If the patient's decision is to die, so do it. Why not end this suffering if we have the power? There is no point waiting for the person to die if there is nothing the doctors can do about it. If the person wishes to die, we should satisfy his last wish. This is why euthanasia should be legal for anyone who desires it."

          "content": "Sympathetic interpreters of the beat generation or the beatniks have described them as \"taking a revenge on society”. The hero of a recent novel “undertakes an alcoholic strike against humanity\". But the phrase \"an alcoholic strike\", like \"a revenge on society\", seems to me merely comic. It suggests the popular saying about \"biting off your nose to spite your face\", that being precisely what some intellectuals (including many somewhat above the beatnik level) are doing — as though turning into a dope addict does not hurt oneself even more than it hurts anyone else. It seems only slightly less obvious that the more responsible intellectuals who devote themselves exclusively to exploring and exploiting their \"alienation\" are doing much the same thing. Surely it is more productive of personal happiness and even \"more useful to society\" to be a candle throwing its beam into a naughty world than a beatnik crying \"revenge, revenge\" from the gutter. We hear a great deal about the responsibility of society toward the individual. The individual also has a responsibility toward society. And if things are as bad as the alienated say, the only way one can discharge that responsibility is by being an honorable man.\n\nI am not preaching universal indifference to society and social action as the highest wisdom. I am saying simply that if and when one individual feels (as so many articulate people do seem to feel) that the world is hopeless, then it is wiser to see what one can do about oneself than to give up all hope of that. I will go so far as to suggest the possibility that society may be in a bad way partly because we have laid so much stress on public education and so little upon self-education.\n\nPerhaps the most curious and shocking result of the exclusive stress upon social rather than upon private ethics is the disappearance of the concept of honor as distinct from that of morality. One of the difference between the two is simply that honor is relevant to the individual only. True, society may be more affected than some social scientists seem to think by the prevalence or scarcity of honor in the code of the individuals who make it up. But the man of honor always asks first whether or not an action would dishonor him personally, and he is not influenced by an argument that his dishonorable act would have no bad (perhaps even some good) effect upon society and is therefore \"moral\" even if dishonorable.\n\nThe world would not now be profcundly shocked as it was a generation ago by the phrase \"a scrape of paper\". We are used to having promises so treated, as if there was nothing immoral in a broken oath. Many college students see nothing wrong about cheating on examinations. \"Everybody does it and it does not really hurt anyone.\"\n\nWhen some scandal breaks in government or journalism or business or broadcasting, the usual reaction of even that part of the public which is shocked by it is to say that it could not have happened if there had been adequate laws supervising this or that activity. But usually, is it not equally true that it could not have happened if a whole group of men, often including the supposed guardians of public morality, had not been devoid of any sense of the meaning and importance of individual integrity? May one not go further and ask whether any amount of \"social consciousness\" and government control can make decent a society composed of people who have no conception of personal dignity and honor? It was a favorite and no doubt sound argument among early twentieth-century reformers that \"playing the game\" as the gentleman was supposed to play it was not enough. But has the time not come to add that it is, nevertheless, indispensable?"

              "correctAnswer": "Big cities like Beijing and Shanghai are developing very fast in China. They have become the first choice for young people after their graduation. However, the disadvantages of staying in big cities outweigh the advantages. Although big cities are attractive for individuals, the quality of life is relatively low. Pollution is a big problem in these modernized places. For example, Shanghai is seriously polluted. We can often see the harmful smog in the morning because the air is full of dust. The water in the Huangpu River is getting filthier. And you can sometimes smell the black and stale water in the Suzhou River miles away. Besides, in spite of the overpasses, subways, and loops built in large cities, transportation is still a headache for the residents, like the situation in Beijing where traffic is a headache. The streets are often filled with people, and the buses are usually packed like sardines in a can during the rush hour. With the popularization of private cars, the situation is becoming even worse. Furthermore, the level of consumption is very high in big cities. To buy the same goods, you have to pay more money. In particular, the price assigned to building properties is much beyond average consumers. Therefore, people find only by working harder and harder can they afford such an expensive life, which will inevitably lead to much stress. The tendency that the society is becoming more and more stressful cannot be stopped and the excessive pressure will be harmful to people both physically and psychologically. People have different choices for life. Before you make your own decision, think over your future carefully. It is not wise to simply follow other people's suit."

When they can't do that they get depressed.\"\n\nCold weather can trigger another hormonal effect. This gives people more energy to keep warm, but renders them more vulnerable to a heart attack when they wind down.\n\nChristmas produces stress for everyone, rushing around doing the shopping and, often for women, doing the cooking.\n\n\"It is when people relax after the exertion that the effects of the stress catch up with them,” said Dr. Carruthers.\n\nDespite being the season of goodwill Christmas is the peak period for depression, heart attacks and suicide.\n\nProf. Cary Cooper of Manchester University's Institute of Science and Technology said that it was a period when families spent more time together.\n\n\"When there is no daily routine, families are thrust back into their own company and adapting to that can be very stressful.\"\n\nHis views were supported by Dr. Robin Skynner, a consultant psychiatrist, who wrote a book with the comedian John Cleese on surviving family life.\n\n\"People are led to expect too much of Christmas. They are led to imagine it will be a time of happiness and goodwill,\" he said.\n\nDr. Skynner recommends lowering expectations as the key to handling the festive season.\n\n\"If people accept that and don't expect too much they will probably end up having a whale of a time.\"\n\nPeter Pallot, Health Service Staff, writes: More than 3,000 marriages end in divorce every week and that process is more likely to start at Christmas than at any other time of the year. According to Relate, formerly the National Marriage Guidance Council, \"The long Christmas period with all the traditional expectations of family closeness makes warring couples feel specially unhappy.\""

          "content": "Water is a prerequisite to all forms of life. The growing lack of access to it has therefore become a serious development concern. UN agencies estimate that there are 1.3 billion people around the world without access to safe drinking water and nearly twice that number lacking adequate sanitation. The disturbing consequence of this situation is 3 million deaths per year, which the World Health Organization attributes to water-related diseases.\n\nDevelopment practitioners emphasize that inadequate access to water is directly linked to poverty. The lack of safe water supplies damages the health, food security and livelihoods of the poor. Although, water should be available to all people regardless of their income or social status, this is not the way things are. An average person in developed nations uses an average of 400-500 liters of water per day, whereas in developing countries the average is around 20 liters per day. In addition to citing this glaring inequality, the United Nations Development Program points out that a majority of people who are affected by contaminated water are found living in the swarming slums of mega-cities and in the marginalized rural areas across developing countries.\n\nWater shortages are particularly severe in South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. According to the Carnegie Institute in the US, Pakistan is facing the most serious water shortage in South Asia. The warning is based on a projection that Pakistan will require 335 billion cubic meters of water per annum by 2025, but will have no more than 236 billion cubic meters available, resulting in a serious shortfall of over one billion cubic meters. Besides the looming threat of severe water shortages - which various other sources estimate will occur even sooner - there is the evident problem of deteriorating water quality.\n\nIn dealing with the issue of water scarcity, it is necessary also to think at the micro level. The government could certainly use more NGO help in this regard. Some NGOs are already promoting traditional conservation methods like rainwater harvesting and creating awareness about the effects of water scarcity and contamination. All relevant stakeholders need to give more attention to the prevailing lack of awareness and sensitivity amongst the people in both urban and rural areas, which becomes a major handicap in rational use of water and in safeguarding its pollution. It is unfortunate that the judicious use of an invaluable commodity like water is nowhere to be seen, particularly amongst those fortunate enough to have easy access to it."

Gone are the days when they thought of self-care as a waste of time, atrophying of budget and most importantly, a threat to their masculinity. \"Makeover\" was a term associated exclusively with females and the gradual change came along courtesy of models and actors. Many believed (and continue to do so even today) that the idea of a man going to a beauty salon sounded bizarre and unmanly and thus, often associated to males who were effeminate. The fact however remains that men are becoming increasingly conscious of the way they look.\n\nWhile women are eager try out Bipasha Basu's hair extensions and Aishwarya Rai's tangled curls, the men derive their inspiration from David Beckham. From the Mohican to a ponytail and from a crew cut and a shaggy mop, this British footballer has sported it all at some time or the other. Closer home, the trend is just starting out and picking up. While many salons are trying to capture a significant percent of the market, few are beginning to enjoy a hidden monopoly, which becomes evident by their growing client base and mounting revenues.\n\nPrince is named after the man who, as well as owning the salon, brings along 14 years of hair-cutting experience with him. Young and enthusiastic, Prince understands the importance of male styling. He, and others like him, cater mostly to the upper crust of society who can easily afford to pay anything from 150 rupees to 600 per cut, which is still better than what many of our A-list stylists are charging. Over a short span, such small, seemingly humble places have become the choice for many of the models and trendsetters of the town who come to get their hair done for parties and social gatherings. A cross between the local and the swanky up-market salons that charge an arm and a leg for a trim, Prince and its counterparts are using their homey feel, less intimidating atmosphere and lower prices to attract a loyal following.\n\nTimes certainly have changed. For women, going to a salon is therapeutic and has transformed from a luxury to a need over the years. Interestingly, men too have become dependent on treatments to look attractive. Stylish haircuts have become the hallmark of a man's taste. For people like me it might be too late already but for all the young men in search of an opportunity to look better, hair it is!"

There really wasn't a \"first April Fools' Day\" that can be pinpointed on the calendar. Some believe it to be evolved simultaneously in several cultures at the same time, from celebrations involving the first day of spring.\n\nThe closest point in time that can be identified as the beginning of this tradition was in 1582, in France. {{61}} The celebration culminated on April 1. With the reform of the calendar under Charles IX, the Gregorian Calendar was introduced, and New Year's Day was moved to January 1.\n\nHowever, communications being what they were in the days when news traveled by foot, many people did not receive the news for several years. Others, the more obstinate crowd, refused to accept the new calendar and continued to celebrate the new year on April 1. {{62}} They were subject to some ridicule, and were often sent on \"fools' errands\" or were made the butt of other practical jokes.\n\nThis harassment evolved, over time, into a tradition of prank-playing on the first day of April. The tradition eventually spread to England and Scotland in the eighteenth century. It was later introduced to the American colonies of both the English and French. {{63}}\n\nIn Scotland, for example, April Fools' Day is actually celebrated for two days. The second day is devoted to pranks involving the posterior region of the body. It is called Taily Day. The origin of the \"kick me\" sign can be traced to this observance.\n\nMexico's counterpart of April Fools' Day is actually observed on December 28. {{64}} It eventually evolved into a lighter commemoration involving pranks and trickery.\n\nPranks performed on April Fools' Day range from the simple (such as saying, \"Your shoe's untied!\"), to the elaborate. Setting a roommate's alarm clock back an hour is a common gag. Whatever the prank, the trickster usually ends it by yelling to his victim, “April Fool!\"\n\nPractical jokes are a common practice on April Fools' Day. Sometimes, elaborate practical jokes are played on friends or relatives that last the entire day. The news media even gets involved. {{65}}\n\nApril Fools' Day is a \"for-fun-only\" observance. Nobody is expected to buy gifts or to take their \"significant other\" out to eat in a fancy restaurant. Nobody gets off work or school. It's simply a fun little holiday, but a holiday on which one must remain forever vigilant, for he may be the next April Fool!",

Job-hopping is beneficial to employees. Working in different fields can make people, especially young people, acquire rich experience, which is valuable for them to be adapted to various environments. After tasting many kinds of jobs, people can accumulate much useful experience and knowledge. In addition, all kinds of chances can be gained in the course of job-hopping. If people are not satisfied with their present job, they have the right to replace it with a more challenging one. Every change is a step toward further success. In the process of job-hopping, it is quite possible to find a position where you can fully display your ability and put your whole heart into it. Only in this way can you get the true joy of achieving your goals. Besides, job-hopping is helpful to raise employees' living standards. Every chance to change a job offers the employee an opportunity to move up to a higher position and to get better wages. Job-hopping is also beneficial to the employers. It gives the employers — the bosses, the managers — the chance to benefit from the new ideas and skills that different people bring to their firms or factories.

          "content": "Language, incontestably, reveals the speaker. Language, alsc, far more dubiously, is meant to define the other — and, in this case, the other is refusing to be defined by a language that has never been able to recognize him.\n\nPeople evolve a language in order to describe and thus control their circumstances or in order not to be submerged by a situation that they cannot articulate. What joins all languages, and all men, is the necessity to confront life, in order, not inconceivably, to outwit death: The price for this is the acceptance, and achievement, of one's temporal identity. So that, for example, though it is not taught in the schools the south of France still clings to its ancient and musical Provencal, which resists being described as a \"dialect\". And much of the tension in the Basque countries, and in Wales, is due to the Basque and Welsh determination not to allow their languages to be destroyed. This determination also feeds the flames in Ireland for among the many indignities the Irish have been forced to undergo at English hands is the English contempt for their language.\n\nIt goes without saying, then, that language is also a political instrument, means, and proof of power. It is the most vivid and crucial key to identity. It reveals the private identity, and connects one with, or divorces one from, the larger, public, or communal identity. There have been, and are, times and places, when to speak a certain language could be dangerous, even fatal. Or, one may speak the same language, but in such a way that one's antecedents are revealed, or hidden. This is true in France, and is absolutely true in England: The range of accents on that damp little island makes England coherent for the English and totally incomprehensible for everyone else. To open your mouth in England is to \"put your business in the street\". You have confessed your parents, your youth, your school, your salary, your self-esteem, and, alas, your future.\n\nNow, I do not know what white Americans would sound like if there had never been any black people in the US, but they would not sound the way they sound. Jazz, for example, is a very specific sexual term, as in Jazz me, baby, but white people purified it into the Jazz Age. There are so many cases like this that some people even attempt to penalize black people for having created a black language that \"pollutes\" the American English.\n\nBlack English is the creation of the black diaspora. Blacks came to the United States chained to each other, but from different tribes. Neither could speak the other's language. If two black people, at that bitter hour of the world's history, had been able to speak to each other, the institution of chattel slavery could never have lasted as long as it did. Subsequently, the slave was given, under the eye, and the gun, of his master, Congo Square, and the Bible or, in other words, and under those conditions, the slave began the formation of the black church, and it is within this unprecedented tabernacle that black English began to be formed. This was not, merely, as in the European example, the adoption of a foreign tongue, but an alchemy that transformed ancient elements into a new language: A language comes into existence by means of brutal necessity, and the rules of the language are dictated by what the language must convey.\n\nThere was a moment, in time, and in this place, when my brother, or my mother, or my father, or my sister, had to convey to me, for example, the danger in which I was standing from the white man standing just behind me, and to convey this with a speed and in a language, that the white man could not possibly understand, and that, indeed, he cannot understand until today. He cannot afford to understand it. This understanding would reveal to him too much about himself and smash that mirror before which he has been frozen for so long."

If computers and computer programs supposedly are getting easier to use, why are so many companies still making a nice living publishing books on how to use them?\n\nComputers manipulate information, but information is invisible. There's nothing to see or touch. The programmer decides what you see on the screen. Computers don't have knobs like old radios. They don't have buttons, not real buttons. Instead, more and more programs display pictures of buttons, moving even further into abstraction and arbitrariness. I like computers, but I hope they will disappear, that they will seem as strange to our descendents as the technologies of our grandparents appear to us. Today's computers are indeed getting easier to use, but look where they started: so difficult that almost any improvement was welcome.\n\nComputers have the power to allow people within a company, across a nation or even around the world to work together. But this power will be wasted if tomorrow's computers aren't designed around the needs and capabilities of the human beings who must use them a people-centered philosophy, in other words. That means retooling computers to mesh with human strengths observing, communicating and innovating instead of asking people to conform to unnatural behavior computer demands. That just leads to error.\n\nMany of today's machines try to do too much. When a complicated word processor attempts to double as a desktop publishing program or a kitchen appliance comes with half a dozen attachments, the products are bound to be unwisely and burdensome. My favorite example of a technological product on just the right scale is an electronic dictionary. It can be made smaller, lighter and far easier to use than a print version, not only giving meanings but even pronouncing the words. Today's electronic dictionaries, with their tiny keys and barely legible displays, are primitive but they're on the right track."

          "content": "Technological characteristics of the factory of the future will be influenced by both \"science push\" and \"market pull\". Science push relates to the many scientific developments that are being announced from laboratories around the world.\n\nThe manufacturing community is alert to these developments and when creative people visualize opportunities to solve major problems with new scientific developments, they are responsive to initiate major projects to attempt to capture a competitive edge. Market pull is the other dimension. The manufacturing community sees opportunities to gain a competitive edge by drawing existing or emerging technologies on to the shop floor, and they are willing to invest in the future. The driving force in both cases is the desire to increase productivity and quality. History has demonstrated that both phenomena are at work in the manufacturing environment.\n\nUnderlying the future of the manufacturing environment of tomorrow are the strategic technologies that we recognize today as playing an important role in our planning in industrial and university research laboratories. Let me elaborate on what I consider the strategic technologies in the laboratory with both medium and long-range perspectives on the future. My strategic technologies include: new materials (including polymers, alloys, ceramics and composites, and superconductors), computer engineering, microelectronics, micro fabrication, photonics, and manufacturing system (automation for machines and processes, new processes, engineering management).\n\nThe reality of the impact of the strategic technologies which I have mentioned is not an issue. What are the issues include: how rapidly will their impact be left, how will the capital investments required be justified, and how will we educate the workforce to implement and manage them. I believe these issues will be resolved in an evolutionary way rather than as a new industrial revolution. There are already unfortunate examples of failure in attempts to implement individual views of factories of the future. The underlying problems will surface when we attempt too much, too soon, and without a through knowledge of all of the important features of strategic technologies and of whether they are fit for an effective manufacturing facility. The lack of standards has been recognized as a major deterrent to integration, and major steps have been taken on a national and worldwide basis to correct the situation. We cannot overestimate the power of the human being to adapt and to succeed. We have not yet duplicated this power with the computer. However, we have achieved the ability to use the computer to make the human more productive, more reliable and more powerful. This is perhaps the beginning for developing a more focused view of what we mean by the factory of the future. The issue of strategic technologies is of great importance to the development of the factory of the future. It is a matter of survival."

He said it appeared that the doors were forced with a crowbar or screwdriver.\n\nBlake, the 71-year-old star of the old \"Baretta\" TV series, married Barkley after DNA tests showed he was the father of her baby. Barkley was shot May 4, 2001, in a car parked near a restaurant where she and Blake had just dined. He is charged with murder and solicitation of murder.\n\nThe jurors were sworn in Wednesday after a prosecutor and defense attorney used numerous challenges to remove panelists from the jury box.

Many maintained that computers should be programmed in sophisticated programming languages that would make it easy for programmers to incorporate the thought process of grandmasters into their programs.\n\nIn addition, computers should be programmed to carry out some sort of selective search as we envision grandmasters do.

While there have been many attempts to program machine learning, there have been no great successes to date. {{65}}\n\nAs computers will remain our partners for the foreseeable future, it is important that we design them in ways that improve our own lives.

Indeed, it is arguable that body shattering is the very point of football, as killing and maining are of war. To grasp some of the more conspicuous similarities between football and war, it is instructive to listen to the imperatives most frequently issued to the players by their coaches, teammates and fans. \"Hurt 'em!\" \"Level 'em!” “Take 'em apart!\" \"Kill 'em!\" Just as in Hockey, where a fight will bring fans to their feet more often than a skillful play, so in football the mouth waters most of all for the really crippling block or tackle.\n\nThe family resemblance between football and war is striking. Their language is similar: \"field general\", \"front line\", \"good hit\" and so on. Their principles and practices are alike: absolute command and total obedience, territorial aggression, blackboard maneuvers and strategies, drills, uniforms, formations, marching bands and training camps. And the virtues they celebrate are almost identical: hyper-aggressiveness, coolness under fire and suicidal bravery. All this has been implicitly recognized by such jock-loving Americans as media stars General Patton and President Nixon, who have talked about war as a football game. Patton wanted to make his Second World War tank men look like football players. And Nixon was fond of comparing attacks on Vietnam to football plays and drawing coachly diagrams on a blackboard TV war fans.\n\nOf course, it would be a mistake to suppose that there is more blind acceptance of brutal practices in organized football than elsewhere. On the contrary, a recent Harvard Study has approvingly argued that football's characteristics of “impersonal acceptance of inflicted injury\", an overriding \"organization goal\", the “ability to turn oneself on and off and being, above all, “out to win\" are of \"inestimable value\" to big corporations. Clearly, our sort of football is no sicker than the rest of our society. Even its organized destruction of physical well-being is not anomalous. A very large part of our wealth, work and time is, after all, spent in systematically destroying and harming human life. Competitive, organized injuring is integral to our way of life, and football is simply one of the more intelligible mirrors of the whole process.\n\nNow it is fashionable to rationalize our collaboration in all this by arguing that, well, man likes to fight and injure his fellows and such games as football should be encouraged to discharge this original-sin urge into less harmful channels than, say, war.\n\nAs an ex-player in the seasonal coast-to-coast drama, I see little to recommend such a view. What organized football did to me was make me suppress my natural urges and re-express them in an alienating, vicious form. Spontaneous desires for free bodily exuberance and fraternization with competitors were shamed and forced under and in their place were demanded armored mechanical moves and cool hatred of all opposition. The players never speak of these things because everybody is so anxious to appear tough.\n\nThe claim that men like seriously to battle one another to some sort of finish is a myth. It only endures because it wears one of the oldest and most propagandized of mask the romantic combatant. I sometimes wonder whether the violence all around us doesn't depend for its survival ' on the existence and preservation of this tough-guy disguise.\n\nAs for the effect of organized football on the spectator, the fan is not released from supposed feelings of violent aggression by watching his athletic heroes perform it so much as encouraged in the view that people-smashing is an admirable mode of self-expression. Indeed, it seems likely that the whole show just further develops and stimulates the North American addiction for violent seif-assertion. Perhaps, as well, it helps explain why the greater the zeal of U.S. political leaders as football fans, the more enthusiastic the commitment to hard-line politics.\n\nWatching well-advertised strong men knock other people round, make them hurt, is in the end like other tastes. It does not weaken with feeding and variation in form. It grows."

And Nixon was fond of comparing attacks on Vietnam to football plays and drawing coachly diagrams on a blackboard TV war fans.\n\nOf course, it would be a mistake to suppose that there is more blind acceptance of brutal practices in organized football than elsewhere. On the contrary, a recent Harvard Study has approvingly argued that football's characteristics of “impersonal acceptance of inflicted injury\", an overriding \"organization goal\", the “ability to turn oneself on and off and being, above all, “out to win\" are of \"inestimable value\" to big corporations. Clearly, our sort of football is no sicker than the rest of our society. Even its organized destruction of physical well-being is not anomalous. A very large part of our wealth, work and time is, after all, spent in systematically destroying and harming human life. Competitive, organized injuring is integral to our way of life, and football is simply one of the more intelligible mirrors of the whole process.\n\nNow it is fashionable to rationalize our collaboration in all this by arguing that, well, man likes to fight and injure his fellows and such games as football should be encouraged to discharge this original-sin urge into less harmful channels than, say, war.\n\nAs an ex-player in the seasonal coast-to-coast drama, I see little to recommend such a view. What organized football did to me was make me suppress my natural urges and re-express them in an alienating, vicious form. Spontaneous desires for free bodily exuberance and fraternization with competitors were shamed and forced under and in their place were demanded armored mechanical moves and cool hatred of all opposition. The players never speak of these things because everybody is so anxious to appear tough.\n\nThe claim that men like seriously to battle one another to some sort of finish is a myth. It only endures because it wears one of the oldest and most propagandized of mask the romantic combatant. I sometimes wonder whether the violence all around us doesn't depend for its survival ' on the existence and preservation of this tough-guy disguise.\n\nAs for the effect of organized football on the spectator, the fan is not released from supposed feelings of violent aggression by watching his athletic heroes perform it so much as encouraged in the view that people-smashing is an admirable mode of self-expression. Indeed, it seems likely that the whole show just further develops and stimulates the North American addiction for violent seif-assertion. Perhaps, as well, it helps explain why the greater the zeal of U.S. political leaders as football fans, the more enthusiastic the commitment to hard-line politics.\n\nWatching well-advertised strong men knock other people round, make them hurt, is in the end like other tastes. It does not weaken with feeding and variation in form. It grows."

              "correctAnswer": "Books are one of the human treasures. We have no difficulty finding that books contain many human experiences and lessons, including love and hatred, failure and success, darkness and brilliance. Books provide us with a shortcut in life if we can follow the path books indicate. Although the importance of books is really widely recognized, it does not mean that knowledge from experience is not important. No book can replace real experience. As the saying goes, \"Wit once bought is worth twice taught.\" For example, on people's first trial of driving a car, even though they are very familiar with the car's equipment, they still find it difficult to drive it skillfully. Therefore, practical training is vital in our life. There is so much knowledge in books that we have to make our own choices through our personal experiences. Learning through experience is reasonable, because you are the best one to know yourself. Knowledge from books can bring you some enlightenment, but only you yourself know your own merits and demerits. One example is the courses offered in colleges. Many students consider some compulsory courses not useful at all, and they might even play truant. Many times, the knowledge we acquire through other people's experience can be more precious than that provided by books. We all have the experience of asking for advice from families, friends or colleagues instead of trusting books. In this age of information, many people like to surf on the Internet to exchange valuable experiences. In fact, knowledge from books and knowledge from experience complement each other. Only if we depend on both of them can we really become more knowledgeable."

          "content": "Earlier this summer, Mike Trevino, 29, slept nine hours in nine days in his quest to win a 3,000-mile, cross-country bike race. For the first 38 hours and 646 miles, he skipped sleep entirely. Later he napped — with no dreams he can remember — for no more than 90 minutes a night. Soon he began to imagine that his support crew was part of a bomb plot. \"It was almost like riding in a movie. I thought it was a complex dream, even though I was conscious,\" says Trevino, who finished second.\n\nTrevino's case may be extreme, but it raises important questions: If we don't sleep (or sleep enough), what happens to our dreams? And if we don't dream, what happens to us? These are not purely academic questions. Nearly 40 percent of Americans report getting fewer than seven hours sleep on weekdays and nearly 60 percent say they experience some kind of insomnia at least several nights a week, according to a National Sleep Foundation poll. \"Sleep may be essential for life,\" says Jerry Siegel, a neuroscientist at UCLA's Center for Sleep Research. \"It's certainly essential for optimum brain function.\"\n\nFor those of us who are stressed, anxious and working too hard, insomnia only makes things worse. When our worries wake us in the middle of a REM cycle, issues that might have been resolved through dreams are left hanging. Dreams tend to get more positive as the night wears on, and waking up too soon interrupts this process. \"People who are sleep deprived are often irritable,\" says Rosalind Cartwright, chairman of psychology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. \"They haven't worked through the bad feelings.\"\n\nDepression interferes with healthy sleeping – and dreaming. In a study published this month, several experts at the University of Pittsburgh stated that \"The brain of depressed dreamers doesn't shut off, it keeps ruminating about things, which makes it hard for the person to get to sleep – or if they do, it wakes them up in the middle of the night to work on all the problems they have.\"\n\nIf you have trouble sleeping, here's what to do: Find out if you have a physical problem such as sleep apnea. If you're physically fine, go to bed and get up at a regular time every day, stay away from caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, and avoid bright lights in the bedroom. Good sleep produces good dreams. \"You'll work better, feel sharper, actually be more creative,\" says Cartwright. No wonder they say that dreams are sweet."

          "content": "The mental health movement in the United States began with a period of considerable enlightenment. Dorothea Dix was shocked to find the mentally ill in jails and almshouses and crusaded for the establishment of asylums in which people could receive humane care and treatment which might help restore them to sanity. By the mid 1800s, 20 states had established asylums, but during the late 1800s and early 1900s, in the face of economic depression, legislatures were unable to appropriate sufficient funds for decent care. Asylums became overcrowded and prison-like. Additionally, patients were more resistant to treatment than the pioneers in the mental health field had anticipated, and security and restraint were needed to protect patients and others. Mental institutions became frightening and depressing places in which the rights of patients were all but forgotten.\n\nThese conditions continued until after World War II. At that time, new treatments were discovered for some major mental illnesses heretofore considered untreatable (penicillin for syphilis of the brain and insulin treatment for schizophrenia and depressions), and a succession of books, motion pictures, and newspaper exposes called attention to the plight of the mentally ill. Improvements were made and Dr. David Vail's Humane Practices Program is a beacon for today. But changes were slow in coming until the early 1960s. At that time, the Civil Rights movement led lawyers to investigate America's prisons, which were disproportionately populated by blacks, and they in turn followed prisoners into the only institutions that were worse than the prisons – the hospitals for the criminally insane. The prisons were filled with angry young men who, encouraged by legal support, were quick to demand their rights. The hospitals for the criminally insane, by contrast, were populated with people who were considered \"crazy\" and who were often kept obediently in their place through the use of severe bodily restraints and large doses of major tranquilizers. The young cadre of public interest lawyers liked their role in the mental hospitals. The lawyers found a population that was both passive and easy to champion. These were, after all, people who, unlike criminals, had done nothing wrong. And in many states, they were being kept in horrendous institutions, an injustice, which once exposed, was bound to shock the public and, particularly, the judicial conscience. Patients' rights groups successfully encouraged reform by lobbying in state legislatures.\n\nJudicial interventions have had some definite positive effects, but there is growing awareness that courts cannot provide the standards and the review mechanisms that assure good patient care. The details of providing day to day care simply cannot be mandated by a court, so it is time to take from the courts the responsibility for delivery of mental health care and assurance of patient rights and return it to the state mental health administrators to whom the mandate was originally given. Though it is a difficult task, administrators must undertake to write rules and standards and to provide the training and surveillance to assure that treatment is given and patient rights are respected."

          "content": "The rise of \"temp\" work has further magnified the decreasing rights and alienation of the worker. It is common corporate practice to phase out full time employees and hire temporary workers to take on more workload in less time. When facing a pressing deadline, a corporation may pay per hour for a temp worker, but the temp worker will only see part of that money. The rest goes to temp agency, which is usually a corporate chain, such as Kelly Services, that blatantly makes its profits off of other people's labor. This increases profits of the corporations because they can increase a workload, get rid of the employee when they're finished, and not worry about paying benefits or unemployment for that employee. I have had to work with temps a few times in my current position, and the workers only want one thing — a full time job with benefits. We really wanted to hire one temp I was working with, but we could not offer her a full time job because it would have been a breach in our contract with the temp agency that employed her. To hire a temp full time, we would have had to pay the agency over a thousand dollars. Through this practice and policy, the temp agency locks its temporary workers into a horrible new form of servitude from which the worker cannot break free.\n\nFurthermore, corporate powers push workers to take on bigger workloads, work longer hours, and accept less benefit by instilling paranoia in their workforce. The capitalist bosses assume dishonesty, disloyalty, and laziness amongst workers, and they breed a sense of guilt and fear through their assumptions where guilt doesn't seep in, bitterness, anger, and depression take over, the highest priorities of Big Business are to increase profits and limit liabilities. Personal relations and human needs are last on their list of priorities. So what we see is a huge mass of people who are alienated, disempowered, overworked, mentally and physically ill and who spend the vast majority of their time and energy on their basic survival. They are denied a chance to really \"live\", because they are forced to make profits for the capitalists in power."

          "content": "The history of coffee is as rich as the brew itself, dating back more than a thousand years. The first coffee plants came from the Horn of Africa. Native tribes would grind the coffee cherries together, mixing the paste with animal fat. Rolled into little balls, the mixture was used to give warriors energy for battle.\n\nDuring these ancient times, coffee's stimulating properties were thought to be a sort of religious ecstasy. The drink earned a mystical reputation, shrouded in secrecy and associated with priests and doctors. {{61}}\n\nAccording to one story, a goat-herder noticed his herd became friskier after consuming the red cherries of a wild coffee shrub. Curious, he tasted the fruit himself. {{62}} Soon the monks began to boil the bean themselves and use the liquid to stay awake during all-night ceremonies.\n\nThe other story is that a Muslim dervish was condemned by his enemies to wander in the desert. In his delirium, the man heard a voice instructing him to eat the fruit from a nearby coffee tree. {{63}} Interpreting his survival and energy as a sign of Allah, he returned to his people, spreading the faith and the recipe.\n\nCoffee cultivation began in the 15th century. For many centuries, Arabia's Yemen province was the world's only source. The demand was very high, and beans leaving the Yemeni port of Mocha were highly guarded. No fertile plants were allowed to leave the country.\n\nDespite the restrictions, Muslim pilgrims to Mecca smuggled coffee plants back to their homelands, and coffee crops soon took root in India. {{64}} Many European merchants grew accustomed to drinking coffee overseas and brought it back with them. The beverage gained popularity when street vendors began selling it.\n\n{{65}} In the 17th century, the Dutch introduced it to their colonies in Indonesia, and the French were the first to start planting it in the Americas. Today, coffee is the second most traded commodity on the planet – only petroleum outranks it!\n\nCoffee is grown all around the world, but only on a belt between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The region where coffee is grown plays a big role in determining its taste – the native soil, climate, elevation and processing methods used in cultivation all impart a distinctive flavour to the beans. A French winemaker wou'd call this \"goût de terroir\" – the \"taste of the place.\"\n\nGeographically, there are three global coffee-growing regions: East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America.",

One is to analyze a work into its several elements but only focus on one or two of them; the other is to analyze a work in its entirety. In analysis, we should follow certain logical orders. Comparison or contrast is used when we can think about authors or works in term of similarities or differences. There are two methods of comparison and contrast. One is block comparison or block contrast. The other is alternating comparison and alternating contrast."
            }
          ],
          "content": "Though the most common meaning of \"criticism\" is something like \"finding fault\", critics often see excellence as well as weaknesses. Good criticism draws our attention to things that are worth attending to. Critical writing has to do with the value of literature, its goodness or badness. In a sense, literary criticism is a natural response to literature, a discourse about a work that interests us, though it is not expressed in a casual, unorganized, or subjective manner.\n\nThere are three common ways of writing a critical paper: explication, analysis, comparison / contrast. Whether long or short, a paper of explication is a close study of the work by itself. It can be a line-by-line commentary on the meaning of a poem by emphasizing the implication of words, the function of rhymes, the shifts in point of view, the development of contrasts, and any other contributions to the meaning. An explication of a poem, such as Robert Frost's \"Design\", is a detailed examination of the whole and can be much longer than the work itself. The method is also suited to a paper that deals only with short passage or section of a story, an important scene in a novel, or a speech or two in a play. Thus, explication is not paraphrase, which is a re-expression of something written or said in different words.\n\nAnalysis can be of two kinds: one is to analyze a work into its several elements but only focus on one or two of them; the other is to analyze a story or a novel in its entirety. Analysis is a more common approach than explication in writing about works longer than a page or two, though both are often-used ways in formalist criticism. When the word limit of the writing task makes it impossible to study all of the elements in a work, the scope of analysis is confined to just one element, though we will not stop there but will go on to suggest its relation to the whole story. The general principle in choosing a topic is to decide on something you can analyze thoroughly rather than something so big that the discussion must be superficial. \"The character of Hester Prynne\" would be a topic for a very long paper, while \"The Effects of Alienation on Hester Prynne\" would be for a shorter paper.\n\nIn writing an analysis we are advised to organize details in a logical order, moving from the lesser material to the greater or from the least important to the most. If the paper is a discussion of the roles of three characters in a story, it must be best to build up to the one of the three that you think is the most complicated.\n\nAn essay of comparison and contrast is much more difficult to handle in organization. When we study two authors or two works of fiction by the same or different authors, it is very natural for us to think about them in terins of similarities or differences. For instance, reading Faulkner's \"Barn Burning\" will make us recall Hawthorne's \"My Kinsman Major Molineux\", and the image of Emily Grierson in \"A Rose for Emily\" will remind us of Joanna Burden in Light in August by the same author. Since comparison/contrast is a mode of our thinking, we need to learn the skill well to make the method more effective. Writing an essay of comparison and contrast is a matter of putting random, associative ideas in order. There are two ways to arrange our thoughts, whether we use comparison, placing two things side by side and pointing out their similarities, or we use contrast, listing out their differences. One way is to examine one thing thoroughly and then turn to the other in similar aspects put down in the same order. This method is called block comparison or block contrast. The other way is to write about the two objects at the same time, discussing them point by point, with the points arranged in a certain order. And the method is called alternating comparison or alternating contrast. What we must avoid doing is to write two separate commentaries of the two objects based on casual items."

              "correctAnswer": "Competition is a common phenomenon in our social life. We compete when we play games. We compete while hunting for a job. And we compete as we do business. However, without cooperation, competition itself can help us get nowhere. We often find that competition exists together with cooperation at the same time. Take a baseball game for example. While one team is competing with the other team, each member of the team is cooperating with his teammates. In most cases, we cannot win in competition without cooperation. Thus, taking risks on a shared basis raises the chance of success and reduces the danger of failure. Besides, in teamwork with others we can reach much further than being alone. For instance, bricks must be combined with steel, concrete and many other materials to make a solid building. A brick itself can do nothing. It is the same with people. The power of one person is limited. We should learn to build team spirit and to work in harmony with others. In addition, cooperation can increase our efficiency and make up for our insufficiency. In boat rowing, if people on boat try to row in different directions, the boat can never reach its destination even though everyone has excellent rowing technique. On the contrary, if people work together with one heart, they will quickly achieve their goal, even though some paddlers might not be good at boating. Nowadays, with the explosion of knowledge, it is impossible to master all knowledge on a subject. Therefore, cooperation appears more and more important and necessary."
