          "content": "To live an aware life, the individual must begin with an awareness of self. He must conduct a running examination and periodic reexaminations of the self in language, the medium of farthest reaches, deepest driving, most complicated windings. The sorting through might well begin with the ordinary, everyday experience of life. A diary of journal enables one to examine and evaluate experiences, as well as to come to understand them and their significance or insignificance. Most of us do this examination and evaluation in moments of dreaming or in that state of mental wandering just before sleep. There is some (even great) advantage, however, in subjecting ourselves to the discipline of written language, in which the vague and the confusing and the poorly defined give way to the specific, the firm, and the clearly formulated.\n\nFor writing is discovery. The language that never leaves our head is like colorful yarn, which endlessly spins out multicolored threads dropping into an emptiness, momentarily compacted, entangled, fascinating, and elusive. We have glimpses that seem brilliant but quickly fade; we catch sight of images that tease us with connections and patterns that too-soon flow on; we hold in momentary view a comprehensive arrangement (insight) that dissolves rapidly and disappears.\n\nWriting that is discovery forces the capturing, the retrieving, the bringing into focus these stray and random thoughts. Examining them, we form ideas that are as much about the self as about language. Indeed, writing is largely a process of choosing, among alternatives from the images and thoughts of the endless flow, and this choosing is the matter of making up one's mind, and this making up one's mind becomes in effect the making up of one's self. In this way writing that is honest and genuine and serious constitutes the discovery of the self.",

          "content": "What should we think of the global euphoria over \"dotcom\" companies? Undoubtedly, Internet technology' will change the way we live, work, communicate and do business. But beware of those who proclaim this to be a New Era of profitability. As in the so-called New Eras of the past brought on by earlier technological breakthroughs this one carries the seeds of its own destruction. The phenomenal growth of Internet businesses is already fueling a Klondike-style.gold rush, with far too many diggers looking for far too little gold. Economics teaches us that it is hard to make money with a basically free commodity. Think of ice in the Arctic, sand in the desert, seawater in the ocean or, for that matter, the seemingly unlimited “hot air” on the Net.\n\nIn the 20th century, the proliferation of cars, radios, movies, televisions, mass retailers and computers all inspired a sense that we had begun a New Era. Each breakthrough promised new riches and unprecedented prosperity for the innovators. But in the long run, they always failed to deliver to investors the expected rewards.\n\nWhy the letdowns? In part because every great innovator invariably attracted great imitators, who competed with the original and eventually depressed his \"excessive\" profit margin by commoditizing the invention. Furthermore, great inventions have always been followed by greater innovations, which, through the process known as creative destruction, render the previous new technology obsolete. And when inventions become vital to the economy, they are frequently brought under the control of governments via regulation, nationalization and, in extreme cases, expropriation.\n\nTake the Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825. Its success led to the great American canal boom of the 1830s. It ended just a few years later in a tremendous bust, as most of the other canals failed to make money. The Erie. too, began to suffer from competition, first from railroads and, eventually, from trucks. In the end, the railroad industry which helped create an unprecedented industrial boom proved to be disastrous for most investors. By 1895, most U.S. railroads had to be restructured\n\nNow-familiar technologies like cars, radios, cash registers and mainframe computers were all at some point new and revolutionary. But the spread of the technologies led inevitably to the demise of their creators' \"excessive\" profits, as each became just another commodity.

Admittedly, we did adopt some foods from the various immigrant groups who flicked to ours shores. We learned to eat Chinese food, pizza, and bagels. But in the last few years, the international character of our diet has grown tremendously. We can walk into any mall in Middle America and buy pita bread, quiches, and tacos. Such foods are often changed on their journey from exotic imports to ordinary \"American\" meals. (no Pakistani, for example, eats frozen-on-a-stick boysenberry-flavored yogurt), but the imports are still a long way from hamburger on a bun.\n\nWhy have we become more worldly in our tastes? For one thing; the television blankets the country with information about new food products and trends. Viewers in rural Montana know that the latest craving in Washington, D. C. is Cajun cookings or that something called tofu is now available in the local supermarket. Another reason for the growing international flavor of our food is that many young Americans have traveled abroad and gotten hooked on new tastes and flavors. Backpacking students and young professional vacationing in Europe come home with craving for authentic French bread or German beer. Finally, continuing waves of immigrants settle in the cities where many of us live, causing significant changes in what we eat. In time, the new food will become Americanized enough to take its place in our national dieta\n\nOur growing concern with health has also affected the way we eat. For the last few years, the media has warned us about the dangers of our traditional diet, high in salt and fat, low in fiber. The media also began to educate us about the dangers of processed foods and manufacturers started to change some of their products. Many foods, such as lunch meat, canned vegetables, and soups were made available in low-fat, low-sodium versions. Whole grain cereals and high fiber breads also began to appear on the grocery shelves. Moreover, the food industry started to produce all. natural products everything from potato chips to ice cream without additives and preservatives. Not surprisingly, the restaurant industry responded to this switch to healthier foods, luring customers with salad bars, broiled fish, and steamed vegetables..",

          "content": "Freud was born on May 6, 1856, in the Moravian town of Freiberg, then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, today a part of Czechoslovakia. The family settled in Vienna in 1860, where as a Jew he enjoyed potential and respect only recently gained with the opening of the Hapsburg Empire's liberal era. Encouraged to think grandly, he poured his energy and gifts into school. At age seventeen, he entered the University of Vienna, where he studied in the faculty of medicine. Engrossed in his studies, he did not graduate until 1881. {{61}}\n\nOver the winter of 1885-1886, Freud studied in Paris with a French: professor of neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot. {{62}} Freud went on to make nervous ailments his specialty, concentrating on hysteria. Freud's years of work put a new way of thinking into the head of society, and challenged the assumptions and suppositions of a changing world.\n\nA period of intense work and self-analysis, further inspired by the death of his father, led Freud to his publication of The Interpretation of Dreams in 1900, and of Psychopathology of Everyday Life in 1901. {{63}} By 1902 he finally gained the position of associate professor at the University of Vienna.\n\nIn 1908, he transformed a Wednesday-night club of Viennese physicians into the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, and his new field began to gain wider acceptance. This period was marked by extensive case studies and theoretical work; as well, he published papers on religion, literature, sculpture, and other non-scientific fields.\n\nDespite some contentious internal politics, psychoanalysis continued to flourish, until World War I took the subjects to the front lines and the analysts to the medical corps. But Freud was not idle: in 1915, he delivered a series of introductory lectures at the University of Vienna, lectures which, when published in 1917, secured him a wide popular audience. A flurry of work, inspired by the death of his daughter Sophie, resulted in the 1920 Beyond the Pleasure Principle and the 1923 The Ego and the Id. The latter work contained a final formulation of his structural theory of the mind.\n\nEven while he became a household word, while his ideas were absorbed by an eager populace, Freud was undergoing painful surgery for cancer in late 1923. {{64}}\n\nHe remained in Vienna despite the rumblings of this catastrophe, as Hitler rose to power and Anti-Semitism swept Europe. {{65}} There, he continued to write, until on September 23, 1939, he finally demanded of his physician a lethal dose of morphine.",

          "content": "There are not many exceptions to the marketing rule, that ideas that are good are not new, and those that new are not good. But last week I discovered one in a Seattle company called Amazon.com, which sells books over the Internet. Before revealing this good new marketing idea, it might be worth explaining something about its inventor, since Amazon.com is one of the few genuinely useful shopping services on the World Wide Web.\n\nThe company runs a Web site, accessible from any PC with a browser, that contains a catalogue of two thirds of the 1.5m English books in print. Finding a title using a search engine, customers can check its availability online, and then order it immediately with a credit card.\n\nShipping prices start at 43 plus 95 cents per book, with higher charges for international and overnight services. But the company discounts 300,000 titles, so most US customers will find that delivery is effectively free. These elements, together with a stock list six times larger than any physical bookseller in the world, make Amazon.com the quickest and most convenient way to buy books I have encountered.\n\nIt is also good for presents: sending a book to someone, buyers can choose from three different wrapping papers and type a message. Such a service is not easy to deliver. The key is that Amazon.com has live electronic links to a dozen wholesalers. Apart from 500 bestsellers, the company keeps zero inventories.\n\nWhen a customer orders a book, Amazon.com orders it from the wholesaler, and when the book arrives in its Seattle warehouse it is barcoded and sent by the company's computer to a bin where the customer's order is being assembled. When all the books in an order have arrived, usually the same day, a manifest is printed and the books are packed for shipping.\n\nThe company's founder Jeff Bezos, 31, is a former investment banker. He says his company is now in an explosive growth stage, doubling in size every 2.4 months. But it cannot continue like this for long. If it did, Amazon.com's sales would exceed US GDP in two years.\n\nUntil recently, its site was as alluring as a copy of \"books in print.\" \"It astounds me how many books we sell,\" says Bezos, “given that we didn't offer people enough information to make decisions.\" The first step to remedying this has been to add blurbs, delivered electronically by publishers, to 170,000 of the listings. The company also invites customers to write reviews, which are then linked by hypertext to the books. And it links book listings to \"interviews” with authors themselves written by filling out a form on a Web page. In future Amazon. com will make these truly interactive, so that readers can ask their favorite authors questions over the Web without having to attend a signing.\n\nAnother service is that the company is planning to put customers in touch with each other. Bezos admits that in a physical bookstore, he rarely has the nerve to look over a fellow's shoulder and recommend a book. “Online, I'd do it in a heartbeat.\" So the company will allow buyers to become \"visible\" if they choose, and to chat online with others browsing electronically in the same subject areas.\n\nAnd the new marketing idea is called associates. By filling in a form on the Amazon Web site, owners of other sites can sign up for a scheme that pays them commissions for referring their own users to the online bookstore. Users will see a page of recommended books on their favorite Web site. Clicking on a title will jump them straight to Amazon.com's order form for that book. If they buy it, the referring Web site gets 8% of the gross. I see it more as a new kind of network marketing, in which Amazon.com has the potential to sign up millions of owners of special-interest Web sites in a vast electronic sales force.",
