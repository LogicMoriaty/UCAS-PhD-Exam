          "content": "To live an aware life, the individual must begin with an awareness of self. He must conduct a running examination and periodic reexaminations of the self in language, the medium of farthest reaches, deepest driving, most complicated windings. The sorting through might well begin with the ordinary, everyday experience of life. A diary of journal enables one to examine and evaluate experiences, as well as to come to understand them and their significance or insignificance. Most of us do this examination and evaluation in moments of dreaming or in that state of mental wandering just before sleep. There is some (even great) advantage, however, in subjecting ourselves to the discipline of written language, in which the vague and the confusing and the poorly defined give way to the specific, the firm, and the clearly formulated.\n\nFor writing is discovery. The language that never leaves our head is like colorful yarn, which endlessly spins out multicolored threads dropping into an emptiness, momentarily compacted, entangled, fascinating, and elusive. We have glimpses that seem brilliant but quickly fade; we catch sight of images that tease us with connections and patterns that too-soon flow on; we hold in momentary view a comprehensive arrangement (insight) that dissolves rapidly and disappears.\n\nWriting that is discovery forces the capturing, the retrieving, the bringing into focus these stray and random thoughts. Examining them, we form ideas that are as much about the self as about language. Indeed, writing is largely a process of choosing, among alternatives from the images and thoughts of the endless flow, and this choosing is the matter of making up one's mind, and this making up one's mind becomes in effect the making up of one's self. In this way writing that is honest and genuine and serious constitutes the discovery of the self."

But beware of those who proclaim this to be a New Era of profitability. As in the so-called New Eras of the past brought on by earlier technological breakthroughs this one carries the seeds of its own destruction. The phenomenal growth of Internet businesses is already fueling a Klondike-style.gold rush, with far too many diggers looking for far too little gold. Economics teaches us that it is hard to make money with a basically free commodity. Think of ice in the Arctic, sand in the desert, seawater in the ocean or, for that matter, the seemingly unlimited “hot air” on the Net.\n\nIn the 20th century, the proliferation of cars, radios, movies, televisions, mass retailers and computers all inspired a sense that we had begun a New Era. Each breakthrough promised new riches and unprecedented prosperity for the innovators. But in the long run, they always failed to deliver to investors the expected rewards.\n\nWhy the letdowns? In part because every great innovator invariably attracted great imitators, who competed with the original and eventually depressed his \"excessive\" profit margin by commoditizing the invention. Furthermore, great inventions have always been followed by greater innovations, which, through the process known as creative destruction, render the previous new technology obsolete. And when inventions become vital to the economy, they are frequently brought under the control of governments via regulation, nationalization and, in extreme cases, expropriation.\n\nTake the Erie Canal, which was completed in 1825. Its success led to the great American canal boom of the 1830s. It ended just a few years later in a tremendous bust, as most of the other canals failed to make money. The Erie. too, began to suffer from competition, first from railroads and, eventually, from trucks. In the end, the railroad industry which helped create an unprecedented industrial boom proved to be disastrous for most investors. By 1895, most U.S. railroads had to be restructured\n\nNow-familiar technologies like cars, radios, cash registers and mainframe computers were all at some point new and revolutionary. But the spread of the technologies led inevitably to the demise of their creators' \"excessive\" profits, as each became just another commodity. Don't think for a minute that the Internet will be any different."

Admittedly, we did adopt some foods from the various immigrant groups who flicked to ours shores. We learned to eat Chinese food, pizza, and bagels. But in the last few years, the international character of our diet has grown tremendously. We can walk into any mall in Middle America and buy pita bread, quiches, and tacos. Such foods are often changed on their journey from exotic imports to ordinary \"American\" meals. (no Pakistani, for example, eats frozen-on-a-stick boysenberry-flavored yogurt), but the imports are still a long way from hamburger on a bun.\n\nWhy have we become more worldly in our tastes? For one thing; the television blankets the country with information about new food products and trends. Viewers in rural Montana know that the latest craving in Washington, D. C. is Cajun cookings or that something called tofu is now available in the local supermarket. Another reason for the growing international flavor of our food is that many young Americans have traveled abroad and gotten hooked on new tastes and flavors. Backpacking students and young professional vacationing in Europe come home with craving for authentic French bread or German beer. Finally, continuing waves of immigrants settle in the cities where many of us live, causing significant changes in what we eat. In time, the new food will become Americanized enough to take its place in our national dieta\n\nOur growing concern with health has also affected the way we eat. For the last few years, the media has warned us about the dangers of our traditional diet, high in salt and fat, low in fiber. The media also began to educate us about the dangers of processed foods and manufacturers started to change some of their products. Many foods, such as lunch meat, canned vegetables, and soups were made available in low-fat, low-sodium versions. Whole grain cereals and high fiber breads also began to appear on the grocery shelves. Moreover, the food industry started to produce all. natural products everything from potato chips to ice cream without additives and preservatives. Not surprisingly, the restaurant industry responded to this switch to healthier foods, luring customers with salad bars, broiled fish, and steamed vegetables.."

The family settled in Vienna in 1860, where as a Jew he enjoyed potential and respect only recently gained with the opening of the Hapsburg Empire's liberal era. Encouraged to think grandly, he poured his energy and gifts into school. At age seventeen, he entered the University of Vienna, where he studied in the faculty of medicine. Engrossed in his studies, he did not graduate until 1881. {{61}}\n\nOver the winter of 1885-1886, Freud studied in Paris with a French: professor of neurology, Jean-Martin Charcot. {{62}} Freud went on to make nervous ailments his specialty, concentrating on hysteria. Freud's years of work put a new way of thinking into the head of society, and challenged the assumptions and suppositions of a changing world.\n\nA period of intense work and self-analysis, further inspired by the death of his father, led Freud to his publication of The Interpretation of Dreams in 1900, and of Psychopathology of Everyday Life in 1901. {{63}} By 1902 he finally gained the position of associate professor at the University of Vienna.\n\nIn 1908, he transformed a Wednesday-night club of Viennese physicians into the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society, and his new field began to gain wider acceptance. This period was marked by extensive case studies and theoretical work; as well, he published papers on religion, literature, sculpture, and other non-scientific fields.\n\nDespite some contentious internal politics, psychoanalysis continued to flourish, until World War I took the subjects to the front lines and the analysts to the medical corps. But Freud was not idle: in 1915, he delivered a series of introductory lectures at the University of Vienna, lectures which, when published in 1917, secured him a wide popular audience. A flurry of work, inspired by the death of his daughter Sophie, resulted in the 1920 Beyond the Pleasure Principle and the 1923 The Ego and the Id. The latter work contained a final formulation of his structural theory of the mind.\n\nEven while he became a household word, while his ideas were absorbed by an eager populace, Freud was undergoing painful surgery for cancer in late 1923. {{64}}\n\nHe remained in Vienna despite the rumblings of this catastrophe, as Hitler rose to power and Anti-Semitism swept Europe. {{65}} There, he continued to write, until on September 23, 1939, he finally demanded of his physician a lethal dose of morphine.",

          "content": "There are not many exceptions to the marketing rule, that ideas that are good are not new, and those that new are not good. But last week I discovered one in a Seattle company called Amazon.com, which sells books over the Internet. Before revealing this good new marketing idea, it might be worth explaining something about its inventor, since Amazon.com is one of the few genuinely useful shopping services on the World Wide Web.\n\nThe company runs a Web site, accessible from any PC with a browser, that contains a catalogue of two thirds of the 1.5m English books in print. Finding a title using a search engine, customers can check its availability online, and then order it immediately with a credit card.\n\nShipping prices start at 43 plus 95 cents per book, with higher charges for international and overnight services. But the company discounts 300,000 titles, so most US customers will find that delivery is effectively free. These elements, together with a stock list six times larger than any physical bookseller in the world, make Amazon.com the quickest and most convenient way to buy books I have encountered.\n\nIt is also good for presents: sending a book to someone, buyers can choose from three different wrapping papers and type a message. Such a service is not easy to deliver. The key is that Amazon.com has live electronic links to a dozen wholesalers. Apart from 500 bestsellers, the company keeps zero inventories.\n\nWhen a customer orders a book, Amazon.com orders it from the wholesaler, and when the book arrives in its Seattle warehouse it is barcoded and sent by the company's computer to a bin where the customer's order is being assembled. When all the books in an order have arrived, usually the same day, a manifest is printed and the books are packed for shipping.\n\nThe company's founder Jeff Bezos, 31, is a former investment banker. He says his company is now in an explosive growth stage, doubling in size every 2.4 months. But it cannot continue like this for long. If it did, Amazon.com's sales would exceed US GDP in two years.\n\nUntil recently, its site was as alluring as a copy of \"books in print.\" \"It astounds me how many books we sell,\" says Bezos, “given that we didn't offer people enough information to make decisions.\" The first step to remedying this has been to add blurbs, delivered electronically by publishers, to 170,000 of the listings. The company also invites customers to write reviews, which are then linked by hypertext to the books. And it links book listings to \"interviews” with authors themselves written by filling out a form on a Web page. In future Amazon. com will make these truly interactive, so that readers can ask their favorite authors questions over the Web without having to attend a signing.\n\nAnother service is that the company is planning to put customers in touch with each other. Bezos admits that in a physical bookstore, he rarely has the nerve to look over a fellow's shoulder and recommend a book. “Online, I'd do it in a heartbeat.\" So the company will allow buyers to become \"visible\" if they choose, and to chat online with others browsing electronically in the same subject areas.\n\nAnd the new marketing idea is called associates. By filling in a form on the Amazon Web site, owners of other sites can sign up for a scheme that pays them commissions for referring their own users to the online bookstore. Users will see a page of recommended books on their favorite Web site. Clicking on a title will jump them straight to Amazon.com's order form for that book. If they buy it, the referring Web site gets 8% of the gross. I see it more as a new kind of network marketing, in which Amazon.com has the potential to sign up millions of owners of special-interest Web sites in a vast electronic sales force."

One hafiz of Koran who had obtained top position said that in Israel children were only taught religion in the first 15 years, but in Pakistan the syllabi were being purged of Islam and Islamic seminaries were being closed down. A boy from Isakhel said that his area needed more colleges especially women's colleges. In the girls college in Isakhel there was only one teacher and the girls had to sit on the floor.\n\nThe information given by the hafiz boy on Israel is not correct. Israel is 97 per cent literate and girls' literacy is 93 per cent. The state-run institutions are not religious. There is a parallel system of religious schools run by the orthodox Jews but that is a minority. In state-run schools, there is no system of 15 years of purely religious education. The state of Israel has not yet been declared a religious state. It doesn't yet have a constitution. For all practical purposes it is a secular state with a strong presence of the religious parties in the Knesset because of Israel's proportional representation system.\n\nOne girl from Peshawar said that private schools had better quality because they taught from imported books. All the students agreed that in English medium schools science education was of better quality because science could not be translated into Urdu. In any case after matriculation students had to convert to English and thus English medium schools were essential. The boy from Isakhel confessed that Urdu did not help in science and that English is essential for which better teachers should be provided. The top students were more interested in saving the Islamic values.\n\nThe girl from Peshawar put her finger on a very important issue. What should we do about the English medium schools? Most politicians who want to change Pakistan and make it better want the English medium schools abolished in favor of equality. There is confusion here on two points. Do we want equality or uniformity? The ideologue wants uniformity of thought and most of us are for ideology as that would enable us better to combat the world. Do we want economic advancement from education or formation of personality? If both, then how do we maintain the balance? Urdu medium schools are at a disadvantage not only because they are less well resourced but also because their science students have to convert to English after matriculation. Across the border, India is less tortured over this issue."

Giordano is good news for all those who wish to keep themselves updated with the latest trends. The brand is doing well in the cosmopolitan city. But then, what doesn't do well there? A famous name, a bit of style...that is all you need to make a place run successfully. Lahore is a different kind of market. Brands here need to offer something more than just their names. Established in 1981, Giordano places emphasis on good fabric and clean cuts, and thus has a relatively good chance of capturing the Lahori market.\n\nThe quiet opening ceremony was held on July 30th and that is probably the reason why most people don't even know Giordano has opened. Is that a marketing gimmick or just a blunder on their behalf? The outlet, located in a basement, is usually hard to find. It literally took me four rounds of the market before I could spot that GIORDANO board. When you think of a basement, you think of a dark gloomy place with spider webs all over. But walking down the stairs to this outlet makes you feel fresh and bright. The shop's interior is done in white, with big posters all over.\n\nThe idea is the outcome of a partnership between Mr. Janjua and Mr. Majid who own the sole distribution of Giordano in Lahore. According to them, the shop has been very successful so far, with the male customers proving to be much more responsive than the female ones. Could this be because our men have all the time in the world and are forever \"on the round\"?\n\nWhen asked about Giordano's competitors in the market, Janjua said that the brand did not have any as such. He feels that Levis and Nike cater to a completely different segment and unless brands like GAP come into the market, Giordano faces no threat. Now that might be called living in a fools' paradise. People here normally have a perception that all international brands are good and alike. Giordano will have to offer something more than just the name and that might take time and effort.\n\nThe start could have been more exciting. People hardly know about the outlet, where it is, what they offer, etc. One billboard is not enough for a market that is surrounded by advertisements. We hope Giordano understands the Lahori psyche, which feels big is better!"

          "content": "It is in the nature of things that the target text displays only the translator's final decisions. Readers perceive an end-product, a result of a decision making process; they do not have access to pathways leading to decisions, to the dilemmas to be resolved by the translator. What is available for scrutiny is the end-product, the result of translation practice rather than the practice itself. In other words, we are looking at translation as product instead of translating as process. Bell suggests that the tendency to ignore the process involved in the act of translating lies behind the relative stagnation of translation studies in recent years. If we treat text merely as a self-contained and self-generating entity, instead of as a decision-making procedure and an instance of communication between language users, our understanding of the nature of translating will be impaired.\n\nThe view that underlies this book, then, is of translation as a process, involving the negotiation of meaning between producers and receivers of texts. In other words, the resulting translated texts are to be seen as evidence of a transaction, a means of retracing the pathways of the translators, decision-making procedures. In the same way, the source text is an end product and again should be treated as evidence of a writer's intended meaning rather than as the embodiment of the meaning itself. In translating metaphor, for example, there is little point in seeking to match target-language words with those in the source-language in isolation from a consideration of the writer's whole worldview. Occurrence of metaphor has a cumulative effect which suggests a particular perception of reality and it is this which the translator seeks to capture.\n\nIn this sense, texts can be seen as the result of motivated choice: producers of texts have their own communicative aims and select lexical items and grammatical arrangement to serve those aims. Naturally, in translating, there are potentially two sets of motivations: those of the producer of the source text and those of the translator."

They all possess a very simple and short digestive system — only three times the length of their bodies. {{61}} Meat-eating animals that hunt in the cool of the night and sleep during the day when it is hot do not need sweat glands to cool their bodies; they therefore do not perspire through their skin, but rather they sweat through their tongues. On the other hand, vegetarian animals spend much of their time in the sun gathering their food, and they freely perspire through their skin to cool their bodies. {{62}} Along with sharp claws, all meat-eaters, since they have to kill mainly with their teeth, possess powerful jaws and pointed, elongated, \"canine\" teeth to pierce tough hide and to spear and tear flesh. They do NOT have molars (flat, back teeth) which vegetarian animals need for grinding their food. Unlike grains, flesh does not need to be chewed in the mouth to predigest it; it is digested mostly in the stomach and the intestines. {{63}} Grass-and-leaf-eating animals live on grass, herbs, and other plants, much of which is coarse and bulky. {{64}} For this reason, grass-and-leaf eaters have 24 special \"molar\" teeth and a slight side-to-side motion to grind their food, as opposed to the exclusively up-and-down motion of carnivores. They have no claws or sharp teeth; they drink by sucking water up into their mouths. Since they do not eat rapidly decaying foods like the meat eaters, and since their food can take a longer time to pass through, they have much longer digestive systems — intestines which are ten times the length of the body. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that a meat diet has an extremely harmful effect on these grass-and-leaf eaters. If a half pound of animal fat is added daily over a long period of time to a rabbit's diet, after two months his blood vessels become caked with fat and the serious disease called atherosclerosis (动脉粥样硬化) develops. {{65}}",

          "content": "Sympathetic interpreters of the beat generation or the beatniks have described them as \"taking a revenge on society”. The hero of a recent novel “undertakes an alcoholic strike against humanity\". But the phrase \"an alcoholic strike\", like \"a revenge on society\", seems to me merely comic. It suggests the popular saying about \"biting off your nose to spite your face\", that being precisely what some intellectuals (including many somewhat above the beatnik level) are doing — as though turning into a dope addict does not hurt oneself even more than it hurts anyone else. It seems only slightly less obvious that the more responsible intellectuals who devote themselves exclusively to exploring and exploiting their \"alienation\" are doing much the same thing. Surely it is more productive of personal happiness and even \"more useful to society\" to be a candle throwing its beam into a naughty world than a beatnik crying \"revenge, revenge\" from the gutter. We hear a great deal about the responsibility of society toward the individual. The individual also has a responsibility toward society. And if things are as bad as the alienated say, the only way one can discharge that responsibility is by being an honorable man.\n\nI am not preaching universal indifference to society and social action as the highest wisdom. I am saying simply that if and when one individual feels (as so many articulate people do seem to feel) that the world is hopeless, then it is wiser to see what one can do about oneself than to give up all hope of that. I will go so far as to suggest the possibility that society may be in a bad way partly because we have laid so much stress on public education and so little upon self-education.\n\nPerhaps the most curious and shocking result of the exclusive stress upon social rather than upon private ethics is the disappearance of the concept of honor as distinct from that of morality. One of the difference between the two is simply that honor is relevant to the individual only. True, society may be more affected than some social scientists seem to think by the prevalence or scarcity of honor in the code of the individuals who make it up. But the man of honor always asks first whether or not an action would dishonor him personally, and he is not influenced by an argument that his dishonorable act would have no bad (perhaps even some good) effect upon society and is therefore \"moral\" even if dishonorable.\n\nThe world would not now be profcundly shocked as it was a generation ago by the phrase \"a scrape of paper\". We are used to having promises so treated, as if there was nothing immoral in a broken oath. Many college students see nothing wrong about cheating on examinations. \"Everybody does it and it does not really hurt anyone.\"\n\nWhen some scandal breaks in government or journalism or business or broadcasting, the usual reaction of even that part of the public which is shocked by it is to say that it could not have happened if there had been adequate laws supervising this or that activity. But usually, is it not equally true that it could not have happened if a whole group of men, often including the supposed guardians of public morality, had not been devoid of any sense of the meaning and importance of individual integrity? May one not go further and ask whether any amount of \"social consciousness\" and government control can make decent a society composed of people who have no conception of personal dignity and honor? It was a favorite and no doubt sound argument among early twentieth-century reformers that \"playing the game\" as the gentleman was supposed to play it was not enough. But has the time not come to add that it is, nevertheless, indispensable?"
