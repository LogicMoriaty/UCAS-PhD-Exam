          "content": "PTV interviewed students who had obtained top positions in the matriculation examination in the country. One hafiz of Koran who had obtained top position said that in Israel children were only taught religion in the first 15 years, but in Pakistan the syllabi were being purged of Islam and Islamic seminaries were being closed down. A boy from Isakhel said that his area needed more colleges especially women's colleges. In the girls college in Isakhel there was only one teacher and the girls had to sit on the floor.\n\nThe information given by the hafiz boy on Israel is not correct. Israel is 97 per cent literate and girls' literacy is 93 per cent. The state-run institutions are not religious. There is a parallel system of religious schools run by the orthodox Jews but that is a minority. In state-run schools, there is no system of 15 years of purely religious education. The state of Israel has not yet been declared a religious state. It doesn't yet have a constitution. For all practical purposes it is a secular state with a strong presence of the religious parties in the Knesset because of Israel's proportional representation system.\n\nOne girl from Peshawar said that private schools had better quality because they taught from imported books. All the students agreed that in English medium schools science education was of better quality because science could not be translated into Urdu. In any case after matriculation students had to convert to English and thus English medium schools were essential. The boy from Isakhel confessed that Urdu did not help in science and that English is essential for which better teachers should be provided. The top students were more interested in saving the Islamic values.\n\nThe girl from Peshawar put her finger on a very important issue. What should we do about the English medium schools? Most politicians who want to change Pakistan and make it better want the English medium schools abolished in favor of equality. There is confusion here on two points. Do we want equality or uniformity? The ideologue wants uniformity of thought and most of us are for ideology as that would enable us better to combat the world. Do we want economic advancement from education or formation of personality? If both, then how do we maintain the balance? Urdu medium schools are at a disadvantage not only because they are less well resourced but also because their science students have to convert to English after matriculation. Across the border, India is less tortured over this issue.",

Giordano is good news for all those who wish to keep themselves updated with the latest trends. The brand is doing well in the cosmopolitan city. But then, what doesn't do well there? A famous name, a bit of style...that is all you need to make a place run successfully. Lahore is a different kind of market. Brands here need to offer something more than just their names. Established in 1981, Giordano places emphasis on good fabric and clean cuts, and thus has a relatively good chance of capturing the Lahori market.\n\nThe quiet opening ceremony was held on July 30th and that is probably the reason why most people don't even know Giordano has opened. Is that a marketing gimmick or just a blunder on their behalf? The outlet, located in a basement, is usually hard to find. It literally took me four rounds of the market before I could spot that GIORDANO board. When you think of a basement, you think of a dark gloomy place with spider webs all over. But walking down the stairs to this outlet makes you feel fresh and bright. The shop's interior is done in white, with big posters all over.\n\nThe idea is the outcome of a partnership between Mr. Janjua and Mr. Majid who own the sole distribution of Giordano in Lahore. According to them, the shop has been very successful so far, with the male customers proving to be much more responsive than the female ones. Could this be because our men have all the time in the world and are forever \"on the round\"?\n\nWhen asked about Giordano's competitors in the market, Janjua said that the brand did not have any as such. He feels that Levis and Nike cater to a completely different segment and unless brands like GAP come into the market, Giordano faces no threat. Now that might be called living in a fools' paradise. People here normally have a perception that all international brands are good and alike. Giordano will have to offer something more than just the name and that might take time and effort.\n\nThe start could have been more exciting. People hardly know about the outlet, where it is, what they offer, etc. One billboard is not enough for a market that is surrounded by advertisements. We hope Giordano understands the Lahori psyche, which feels big is better!",

Readers perceive an end-product, a result of a decision making process; they do not have access to pathways leading to decisions, to the dilemmas to be resolved by the translator. What is available for scrutiny is the end-product, the result of translation practice rather than the practice itself. In other words, we are looking at translation as product instead of translating as process. Bell suggests that the tendency to ignore the process involved in the act of translating lies behind the relative stagnation of translation studies in recent years. If we treat text merely as a self-contained and self-generating entity, instead of as a decision-making procedure and an instance of communication between language users, our understanding of the nature of translating will be impaired.\n\nThe view that underlies this book, then, is of translation as a process, involving the negotiation of meaning between producers and receivers of texts. In other words, the resulting translated texts are to be seen as evidence of a transaction, a means of retracing the pathways of the translators, decision-making procedures. In the same way, the source text is an end product and again should be treated as evidence of a writer's intended meaning rather than as the embodiment of the meaning itself. In translating metaphor, for example, there is little point in seeking to match target-language words with those in the source-language in isolation from a consideration of the writer's whole worldview. Occurrence of metaphor has a cumulative effect which suggests a particular perception of reality and it is this which the translator seeks to capture.\n\nIn this sense, texts can be seen as the result of motivated choice: producers of texts have their own communicative aims and select lexical items and grammatical arrangement to serve those aims. Naturally, in translating, there are potentially two sets of motivations: those of the producer of the source text and those of the translator.",

          "content": "Carnivorous animals have many unique characteristics which set them apart from all other members of the animal kingdom. They all possess a very simple and short digestive system — only three times the length of their bodies. {{61}} Meat-eating animals that hunt in the cool of the night and sleep during the day when it is hot do not need sweat glands to cool their bodies; they therefore do not perspire through their skin, but rather they sweat through their tongues. On the other hand, vegetarian animals spend much of their time in the sun gathering their food, and they freely perspire through their skin to cool their bodies. {{62}} Along with sharp claws, all meat-eaters, since they have to kill mainly with their teeth, possess powerful jaws and pointed, elongated, \"canine\" teeth to pierce tough hide and to spear and tear flesh. They do NOT have molars (flat, back teeth) which vegetarian animals need for grinding their food. Unlike grains, flesh does not need to be chewed in the mouth to predigest it; it is digested mostly in the stomach and the intestines. {{63}} Grass-and-leaf-eating animals live on grass, herbs, and other plants, much of which is coarse and bulky. {{64}} For this reason, grass-and-leaf eaters have 24 special \"molar\" teeth and a slight side-to-side motion to grind their food, as opposed to the exclusively up-and-down motion of carnivores. They have no claws or sharp teeth; they drink by sucking water up into their mouths. Since they do not eat rapidly decaying foods like the meat eaters, and since their food can take a longer time to pass through, they have much longer digestive systems — intestines which are ten times the length of the body. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that a meat diet has an extremely harmful effect on these grass-and-leaf eaters. If a half pound of animal fat is added daily over a long period of time to a rabbit's diet, after two months his blood vessels become caked with fat and the serious disease called atherosclerosis (动脉粥样硬化) develops. {{65}}",

The hero of a recent novel “undertakes an alcoholic strike against humanity\". But the phrase \"an alcoholic strike\", like \"a revenge on society\", seems to me merely comic. It suggests the popular saying about \"biting off your nose to spite your face\", that being precisely what some intellectuals (including many somewhat above the beatnik level) are doing — as though turning into a dope addict does not hurt oneself even more than it hurts anyone else. It seems only slightly less obvious that the more responsible intellectuals who devote themselves exclusively to exploring and exploiting their \"alienation\" are doing much the same thing. Surely it is more productive of personal happiness and even \"more useful to society\" to be a candle throwing its beam into a naughty world than a beatnik crying \"revenge, revenge\" from the gutter. We hear a great deal about the responsibility of society toward the individual. The individual also has a responsibility toward society. And if things are as bad as the alienated say, the only way one can discharge that responsibility is by being an honorable man.\n\nI am not preaching universal indifference to society and social action as the highest wisdom. I am saying simply that if and when one individual feels (as so many articulate people do seem to feel) that the world is hopeless, then it is wiser to see what one can do about oneself than to give up all hope of that. I will go so far as to suggest the possibility that society may be in a bad way partly because we have laid so much stress on public education and so little upon self-education.\n\nPerhaps the most curious and shocking result of the exclusive stress upon social rather than upon private ethics is the disappearance of the concept of honor as distinct from that of morality. One of the difference between the two is simply that honor is relevant to the individual only. True, society may be more affected than some social scientists seem to think by the prevalence or scarcity of honor in the code of the individuals who make it up. But the man of honor always asks first whether or not an action would dishonor him personally, and he is not influenced by an argument that his dishonorable act would have no bad (perhaps even some good) effect upon society and is therefore \"moral\" even if dishonorable.\n\nThe world would not now be profcundly shocked as it was a generation ago by the phrase \"a scrape of paper\". We are used to having promises so treated, as if there was nothing immoral in a broken oath. Many college students see nothing wrong about cheating on examinations. \"Everybody does it and it does not really hurt anyone.\"\n\nWhen some scandal breaks in government or journalism or business or broadcasting, the usual reaction of even that part of the public which is shocked by it is to say that it could not have happened if there had been adequate laws supervising this or that activity. But usually, is it not equally true that it could not have happened if a whole group of men, often including the supposed guardians of public morality, had not been devoid of any sense of the meaning and importance of individual integrity? May one not go further and ask whether any amount of \"social consciousness\" and government control can make decent a society composed of people who have no conception of personal dignity and honor? It was a favorite and no doubt sound argument among early twentieth-century reformers that \"playing the game\" as the gentleman was supposed to play it was not enough. But has the time not come to add that it is, nevertheless, indispensable?",
