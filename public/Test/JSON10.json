This translates into the American politics of the 19th century — males get to vote; females do not. This clearly was a more primitive time in the politics of democracy. Without debating how far we have advanced in the U.S., this issue is still being fought in the cities and towns of Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and other countries in the Islamic world and elsewhere.\n\nIn a modern age, it is difficult to maintain that men have anything other than size and strength as an advantage over women. Yet, we continue to argue — openly or implicitly — that men should be leaders and women should not. Look at the upcoming 2004 presidential election. Both parties have played up the roles of military experience and leadership as critical factors in potential political chiefdom. It is the same as saying that political leaders have to be warriors. This certainly would rule out the leadership skills of women, few of whom serve in combat roles let alone have opportunities to lead a screaming charge. Biology determines the nature of political rule.\n\nPrimitive is the not the same as \"uncivilized,\" at least not in the way the latter word has been used by the Bush Administration in labeling terrorists. War is war and there is nothing more primitive in the deeds of the terrorists than in those of the U.S. armed forces. Uncivilized in this usage really just means \"not from our civilization.\" It does not signify primitive, although it certainly is implied.\n\nThe word also is sometimes incorrectly used to mean brutal or inhumane. Here we have to be cognizant of writer Mark Twain's observation that those acts we label as “inhumane\" are really only those behaviors conducted by humans, so it is a misnomer at best. Among humans, brutality is something that we want to think of as reflecting human behavior of an earlier time. Torture, rape, genocide, and use of insidious weapons are methods that we want to associate with ruthless Mongolian warlord Genghis Khan. Then we have Rwanda, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Myanmar, Sudan, Cambodia under Pol Pot, the Congo, and numerous others (some specifically unnamed) where each of these behaviors has been ruthlessly employed. Were we being primitives just last year or last month?"

Take a trek through the jungles of Borneo, and in short order you will have festering sores on your skin and bugs all over your body, biting in your hair and crawling up your nose and into your ears. You will have infections and sickness, and if you are not with somebody who knows what he or she is doing, you very rapidly will starve to death. Chances are that even in the jungles of Borneo you will not experience nature so directly since you will have covered your entire body with DEET.\n\nThe truth is, almost nobody wants to experience real nature. What people desire is to spend a week or two in a cabin in the woods, with screens on the windows. They want a simplified life for a while, a nice river rafting trip for a few days, with somebody else doing the cooking. Nobody wants to go back to nature in any real sense, and no one does. It is all talk, and as the years go on and the world population grows increasingly urban, it is uninformed talk. Farmers know of what they speak; city people do not. They just their fantasies.\n\nOne way to measure the prevalence of fantasy is to note the number of people who die because they have not the least knowledge of how nature truly is. They stand beside wild animals, like buffalo, for a picture and get trampled; they climb a mountain in dangerous weather, without the proper gear, and freeze to death. They drown in the surf on their holiday because they cannot conceive the real power of what we blithely call \"the force of nature.\" They have seen the ocean, but they never have been in it.\n\nThe television generation expects nature to act the way they picture it. They think all life experiences can be TiVo-ed. The notion that the natural world obeys its own rules and does not give a damn about their expectations comes as a massive shock. Well-to-do, educated individuals in an urban environment experience the ability to fashion their daily lives as they wish. They buy clothes that suit their taste and decorate their apartments as they like. Within limits, they can contrive a daily urban world that pleases them. The natural world is not so malleable, however. On the contrary, it will demand that you adapt to it and if you do not, you will die. It is a harsh, powerful, and unforgiving world that most urban Westerners never have experienced."

American farm policy is filled with such stumpers.\n\nConsider that federal cash payments to individuals — the program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children — were widely criticized for creating intergenerational dependency on the federal government and allowing people to maintain an idle lifestylc. Yct cash payments to American farmers are justified by some precisely because they promote intergenerational dependency on government and allow for an idle lifestyle.\n\n\"If we'd kept our land in wheat, the fixed costs for equipment and fertilizer would have played havoc with our budget,\" North Dakota farmer Lyle Sjostrom told The New York Times in late August. He dedicated 40 percent of his 4,000 acres to the federal government's conservation prograın, a move he credits with allowing his son, a full-time seed peddler, to become a farmer in his spare time. (When women on welfare work a job on the side to supplement their government checks it's considered welfare fraud, but when farmers take outside jobs, such as selling seeds or legislating farm policy, it's considered noble.)\n\nOthers praise farm handouts for the leisure they provide. \"Subsidies are critical to most gentlemen farming in Arkansas,” Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.) told the Times.\n\nLincoln is one of seven congressional farmers who receive thousands of dollars every year from taxpayers. Some, like Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Texas), an author of farm legislation, find value in dependence on government. \"Working a farm and relying on subsidies has been a plus for me,\" Stenholm told the Times. Perhaps that's why Stenholm joined with Rep. Marion Berry (D-Ark.) in voting against the modest tax cut passed earlier this year. They recognized that handing people's money back in individual increments of up to $300 means there is less money for five- and six-figure checks to farmers such as themselves. (Berry's family enterprises raked in $649,750 in farm subsidies over the last five years. Stenholm received $39,298 over tne same period.)\n\nAdvocates for American farmers are extremely worried about what the declining fortune of the federal treasury means for them. In July, Democrats were forced to accept $2 billion less in the routine emergency farm bill (the end result: farmers only got a bonus $5.5 billion in their pockets this time around). And, as of press time, the House was set to debate a 10-year, $171 billion farm package that guarantees payments to indigent farmers."

          "content": "Malnutrition during weaning age — when breast milk is being replaced by semi-solid foods — is highly prevalent in children of poor households in many developing countries. While the etiology is complex and multi-factorial, the immediate causes are recognized as feeding at less than adequate levels for child growth and development, and recurrent infections, including diarrhoea resulting mainly from ingestion of contaminated foods. Special weaning foods are seldom available at a cost affordable by the poor households. {{61}} Such traditional weaning food preparations do not satisfy the energy and other nutrient needs if they are either too liquid and, thus, have a very low energy density, or too bulky from which enough cannot be consumed by young children. On the other hand, the preparation itself is often contaminated with various germs. Highly contaminated weaning foods are reported to be associated with severity of malnutrition in young children. {{62}} Under conditions such as lack of clean water, refrigerator, fuel, adequate sewage disposal, as well as enough time to prepare fresh food for every meal it is hardly possible to provide young children with uncontaminated weaning foods. As a result of insufficient food intake and frequent diarrhoea, many young children, particularly between 6 months to two years of age, experience weight loss and impaired growth and development.\n\n{{63}} How to reach these goals in simple, practical and economical ways has been the subject of extensive studies by investigators from Ghana, India, Tanzania, Sweden and other countries in recent years. The efforts, concentrated on traditional food preparation methods, have resulted in offering cheap and practical answers to these problems from familiar, indigenous and culturally acceptable home-processing practices. {{64}}\n\nFirstly, cereal fermentation is used for reducing the risk of contamination under the existing inappropriate conditions for food preparation and storage in many households. Secondly, trials in some developing countries indicate the value of using a tiny amount of sprouted grains' flour in preparation of weaning foods as a magic way to thin down the viscosity without decreasing energy density. {{65}}"

              "correctAnswer": "A doctor's function has changed over time. In the past, the doctor was a person who treated the diseases. Now a doctor is a stranger who combats diseases. They are expected not only to prevent death but also to improve their patient's quality of life. Many times there is nothing a doctor can do to prevent a patient from dying if the patient has a terminal disease; all he/she can do is waiting for death to arrive. This waiting time can be very painful for both the patients and the people who surround them. Not practicing euthanasia at the request of the dying person is violating a person's rights, creating an economic burden and increasing suffering. First of all, deciding to be alive or not is a personal decision. Neither the doctors nor the government has the power to decide if you should live or not. Since it is not their life and you are not in your situation, they cannot make that kind of decision for you. They give us the liberty to decide our job, our family, our religion, and even our sex preference. Why should they not give us the right to decide if we want to live or not? Next, the economic factor should be considered. Many times we are just wasting time and money on a situation that won't get better. If the patient wants euthanasia, why not do it and end the huge amount of money wasted on a treatment that won't help.. Finally, the basic reason why euthanasia should be practiced is because it stops the person from suffering. Having a patient suffering is not giving him a better quality of life. When the patient feels he is not getting the quality of life he wants, the least a doctor can do is grant him what he wants. If the patient's decision is to die, so do it. Why not end this suffering if we have the power? There is no point waiting for the person to die if there is nothing the doctors can do about it. If the person wishes to die, we should satisfy his last wish. This is why euthanasia should be legal for anyone who desires it."

          "content": "Americans rank a bright, white smile as one of the most important aspects of an attractive appearance. Yet adults in our country get a barely passing grade when it comes to taking care of their teeth. According to the Academy of General Dentistry, almost 60 percent of Americans don't even have a dentist.\n\nOur poor oral health report card means that diseases that start in the mouth have reached epidemic proportions, according to a report released by former surgeon general David Satcher, M.D. \"We're just beginning to understand how the mouth serves as a gateway to infections that can trigger a host of chronic diseases,\" says Gordon L. Douglass, D.D.S., president of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP). That's why visiting a dentist regularly can be a lifesaver.\n\nExcuses for neglecting oral health are predictable enough — people fear the pain, the cost and the scary diagnosis they might hear precisely because they've stayed away for so long. Here's some good news to entice them back: “The dentist's office is no longer a torture chamber,\" says Richard Hansen, D.M.D., whose practice is in Fullerton, California. \"We're investing in comfortable, heated cushions for the chairs and virtual-reality headsets, for example.\" Dr. Hansen and a growing number of dentists are also setting aside the drill in favor of technology that eliminates almost entirely the pain and the shots associated with filling cavities and other common procedures. And finally, \"Some of the therapeutic procedures used today have a huge cosmetic bonus,\" says New York City's Jonathan Levine, D.M.D., a specialist in reconstructive and cosmetic dentistry. \"They can actually make your teeth look better.\"\n\n\"Finding cavities sooner allows us to use pinpoint fillings,\" says Dr. Hansen. He explains that removing and replacing small areas of decay is far preferable to creating a huge hole in the tooth's core to clear away a more advanced cavity — a process that compromises the strength and longevity of the tooth. Some of the most significant advancements in dentistry have affected restoration, repair and replacement work — which now result in teeth being stronger, healthier and also more attractive. Dr. Levine calls this marriage of health and good looks \"functional aesthetics.\" For example, he explains, \"If the enamel on several of your teeth has eroded from wear, which can compromise their health, we can repair that damage with certain substances. At the same time, we can reshape and realign those teeth, if necessary, to make your smile more cosmetically appealing, as well as correct how the teeth come together. Often the proper realignment and reshaping of teeth will prevent the same wear from happening again.\"\n\nPeriodontal disorders, which affect a third of America's adult population, start mildly enough, often with gingivitis, an easily reversible condition caused by bacteria-laden plaque, with symptoms that include swollen, tender and bleeding gums. Mounting research suggests that gingivitis, if left untreated, spreads to threaten much more than the mouth: Full-blown periodontal disease can contribute to the blood clotting that causes heart attacks and strokes; it's also linked to the onset of type 2 diabetes, chronic bronchitis and, among pregnant women, premature delivery.\n\nIn the case of diabetes, the chain reaction seems to start with bacteria entering the bloodstream, where they cause immune cells to produce high levels of substances that can damage the cells responsible for insulin production, according to new research. When it comes to heart disease, bacteria and their byproducts cause inflammation in the arteries, which may contribute to blockages.\n\nAnd with chronic bronchitis and emphysema, research suggests that bacteria in the mouth travel via inhalation to lodge in lung tissue, making the existing diseases worse. People with family histories of these diseases are at the highest risk — but only after the underlying periodontal disorder is full-blown are the chain reactions triggered.\n\nOral cancer, the sixth most common cancer worldwide, is life threatening, too. To aid in early detection, the ADA has launched a campaign to encourage adults to examine themselves for suspicious lumps and lesions. Currently, because these cancers are usually caught after they've spread to the lymph nodes in the neck, for example — only about half of all oral-cancer sufferers survive for more than five years after diagnosis. If your dentist doesn't initiate a checkup, insist on one. And it's a misperception that all oral cancers are caused by cigarettes, according to Sol Silverman, D.D.S., a spokesperson for the ADA. A full 25 percent of oral cancers strike nonsmokers, he says.\n\nThe bottom line, according to the AAP: Three easy oralhealth habits — twice-daily brushing, daily flossing and twice-annual dental checkups, including tooth cleaning — stop gingivitis before it can progress. Establishing these routine and low-cost habits can eliminate the need for the enormously expensive restorative work that's typically required later in life if oral health has been neglected."
